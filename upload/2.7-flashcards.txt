They can be made of various materials, such as concrete, metal, or plastic, and are often used in emergencies or during events to manage crowds and restrict access.
Access control vestibules;enclosed entryways designed to enhance security by controlling the flow of people entering or exiting a building. These vestibules typically have multiple doors, ensuring that individuals cannot directly enter the main building without passing through a controlled checkpoint. This setup helps in verifying identities, checking badges, and ensuring only authorized personnel gain access.
Badges;physical or electronic cards worn or carried by individuals to provide identification and access privileges within a specific facility. They often contain personal information, a photograph, and access permissions encoded in electronic form (in the case of smart cards or RFID badges). Badges are essential for ensuring that only authorized individuals can enter restricted areas.
Alarms;security devices that generate audible, visual, or both types of alerts in response to specific events or triggers.
