Redundancy;refers to the practice of having backup systems or components in place to ensure continuous operation and data integrity in case of a system failure or cyber attack. Redundant systems are duplicates of critical components, allowing seamless switching to backup resources if the primary ones fail, thereby enhancing system reliability and fault tolerance.
Geographic dispersal;distributing data, resources, or IT infrastructure across different geographical locations. This strategy aims to reduce the risk of a single point of failure due to natural disasters, geopolitical events, or localized cyber attacks. By spreading assets geographically, organizations enhance their resilience and ensure that operations can continue even if one location is compromised, promoting business continuity and data security.
Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) levels;a technology that uses multiple disk drives to enhance performance, reliability, or a combination of both. There are different RAID levels, each with its own method of organizing data across the drives. Common RAID levels include RAID 0 (striping for performance), RAID 1 (mirroring for redundancy), RAID 5 (striping with parity for both performance and redundancy), and RAID 10 (a combination of mirroring and striping). These configurations provide redundancy by duplicating or distributing data across multiple disks, ensuring data integrity and availability even if one or more disks fail.
Multipath;the ability of a system to use multiple physical paths (such as network connections or storage controllers) between the server and storage devices. Multipath redundancy ensures continuous access to storage resources, even if one path fails. In the event of a path failure, the system automatically switches to an alternate path, preventing disruptions and ensuring data availability and reliability. Multipath configurations are commonly used in storage area networks (SANs) and other enterprise storage environments to enhance fault tolerance and system stability.
Load balancers;devices or software applications that distribute network traffic across multiple servers or network resources. They optimize the utilization of these resources, prevent overload on individual servers, and ensure high availability and reliability of services. Load balancers enhance redundancy by distributing incoming traffic evenly among multiple servers, allowing for efficient handling of requests and providing fault tolerance. In case one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to other healthy servers, ensuring continuous service availability.
Network interface card (NIC) teaming;also known as NIC bonding or network interface bonding, is a technique where multiple network interface cards (NICs) on a computer or server are combined to act as a single logical interface. By teaming NICs, redundancy and network performance can be improved. If one NIC fails, the system can automatically switch to the backup NIC(s), ensuring uninterrupted network connectivity. NIC teaming is commonly used to enhance fault tolerance, load balancing, and network resilience in enterprise environments.
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS);an electrical device that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. It offers short-term power backup during electrical outages, allowing connected devices, such as computers and servers, to shut down properly or continue running for a brief period. UPS systems provide redundancy by ensuring a continuous power supply, even in the event of power fluctuations or outages.
Generator;a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. It serves as a backup power source during prolonged power outages. Generators are often fueled by diesel, natural gas, or other fuels. They provide redundancy by generating electricity independently of the main power grid, allowing essential systems and operations to continue functioning during extended power failures.
Dual supply;refers to the configuration where critical systems or equipment are powered by two independent power sources. If one power source fails, the system seamlessly switches to the alternative power supply, ensuring uninterrupted operation. This redundancy measure safeguards against power failures and enhances the reliability of the infrastructure.
Managed power distribution units (PDUs);devices used to distribute electric power to multiple equipment units within a data center or network environment. Unlike basic PDUs, managed PDUs provide features such as remote monitoring, power usage tracking, and outlet control. They enhance redundancy by allowing administrators to monitor power consumption, remotely reset devices, and ensure balanced power distribution. Managed PDUs contribute to efficient power management and help prevent overloads, improving overall system reliability.
Storage area network;a dedicated high-speed network that connects and provides access to a pool of storage devices, such as disk arrays or tape libraries, to multiple servers. SANs are designed to enhance storage efficiency, availability, and performance. Replication in SAN context involves creating duplicate copies of data on separate storage devices or locations. These replicated copies serve as backups and ensure data redundancy, allowing for quick recovery in case of hardware failures or disasters.
VM;a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs applications and operating systems as if they were installed on physical hardware. VMs allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, enabling efficient resource utilization and flexibility. In terms of replication, VM replication involves creating and maintaining identical virtual machine instances on different physical servers or data centers. This redundancy strategy ensures that if one server or data center fails, the replicated VMs can be activated, providing continuity of services and minimizing downtime. VM replication is a key component of disaster recovery and business continuity planning in virtualized environments.
Full;copying all the data in a system or application at a specific point in time. Subsequent backups typically rely on this full backup as a reference point.
Incremental;only copy data that has changed since the last backup, whether it's a full backup or a previous incremental backup. They save storage space and time compared to full backups.
Snapshot;a read-only copy of a system's data at a specific point in time. It allows you to revert to that point if data is lost or corrupted, but it's not a full backup.
Differential;captures all changes made since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, which reference the last backup (either full or incremental), differentials always refer back to the last full backup.
Tape;involve storing data on magnetic tape cartridges. Tapes are a traditional, cost-effective method for long-term data storage and archival.
Disk;store data on hard drives or solid-state drives. Disk-based backups are faster and more accessible than tape backups.
Copy;duplicates the data without any special software or awareness of the backup status. It's essentially copying files to another location for redundancy.
Network-attached storage (NAS);a storage device connected to a network, providing centralized data access to multiple clients. It can be used for backups and file sharing.
Storage area network;a high-speed network providing access to storage resources. It's used to enhance storage efficiency and offer redundancy and scalability.
Cloud;storing data in remote servers accessed via the internet. It provides scalable, offsite storage with accessibility from anywhere.
Image;captures an exact copy of a computer's hard drive, including the operating system and application configurations. It's useful for full system recovery.
Online vs. offline;Online backup refers to backing up data to a server or storage system accessible via the internet. Offline backup involves physically disconnecting storage media after the backup, protecting it from online threats.
Offsite storage;keeping backup copies at a location physically separate from the original data. This protects against disasters that could affect the primary location.
Distance considerations;refer to ensuring that the offsite storage location is far enough from the primary location to avoid being affected by the same disasters (like earthquakes, floods, etc.). The distance ensures geographic redundancy.
Non-persistence;refers to a system or configuration where changes made to the software, settings, or data are not permanent and do not persist after a reboot or power cycle. In non-persistent systems, any modifications made during a session are discarded upon restart, returning the system to its original state.
Revert to known state;restoring a system, application, or device to a previously documented and verified state. This process eliminates any changes, configurations, or issues that occurred after the known state was established, ensuring a clean and stable system.
Last known-good configuration;a recovery feature in Windows operating systems. When a system fails to boot after a change in hardware or software configuration, LKGC allows the system to revert to the most recent configuration in which it successfully booted. This can help troubleshoot issues caused by recent changes.
Live boot media;refers to removable storage devices (such as USB drives or DVDs) that contain a bootable operating system. Users can boot their computers directly from this media without installing the OS on the computer's hard drive. Live boot media allows users to run an operating system and access files on a computer without making changes to the installed system, providing a non-persistent environment for various purposes like troubleshooting, data recovery, or system testing.
High availability;refers to the design and implementation of systems or services that are operational and accessible for a high percentage of the time. In computing, high availability systems are designed to minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation, often through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and fault-tolerant configurations. The goal is to provide users with uninterrupted access to services, even in the face of hardware failures, software glitches, or other types of disruptions.
Scalability;the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. A scalable system can adapt and expand to handle increased demands efficiently without compromising performance or reliability. Scalability is crucial in various contexts, such as web applications, databases, and cloud services, where the demand for resources can fluctuate dramatically. Scalable systems can handle both current and future loads without requiring a complete redesign or significant performance degradation.
Restoration order;refers to the predetermined sequence or priority in which systems, services, or data are restored after a disruption or disaster. It outlines the specific steps and procedures to follow when recovering IT systems, applications, and data to ensure a swift and organized restoration process. Restoration order is a crucial component of disaster recovery and business continuity planning, helping organizations prioritize critical functions and minimize downtime during recovery efforts.
Technologies;Using diverse technologies ensures that if one system or software is compromised, others can still function. This redundancy enhances overall system resilience.
Vendors;Relying on a single vendor for all your cybersecurity solutions can create a single point of failure. Diverse vendors mean that if a vulnerability is found in one vendor's product, it doesn't jeopardize all of your security infrastructure.
Crypto;Diverse cryptographic algorithms and methods can increase security. If one algorithm is compromised, systems using different algorithms remain secure. It also provides a fallback option if a particular cryptographic scheme is weakened or broken.
Controls;Different controls (policies, procedures, technical controls, etc.) address various aspects of security. A diverse set of controls ensures comprehensive coverage, addressing different types of threats and vulnerabilities.
