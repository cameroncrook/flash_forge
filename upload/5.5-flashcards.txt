Reputation damage;the harm or negative impact on the public perception of an organization. In the context of privacy and data breaches, if an organization fails to protect sensitive information, it can lead to a loss of trust among customers, partners, and the public. A damaged reputation can have long-lasting effects on the success and credibility of the organization.
Identity theft;an unauthorized individual gains access to personal information, such as names, Social Security numbers, or financial data, with the intent to commit fraud or other criminal activities. In the context of data breaches, the exposure of sensitive personal information can lead to an increased risk of identity theft for the affected individuals.
Fines;monetary penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or authorities as a consequence of non-compliance with data protection and privacy regulations. Organizations that fail to adequately protect sensitive data may be subject to fines. Various data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, impose fines for violations.
IP theft;the unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of intellectual property, which includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. In the context of data breaches, there is a risk that sensitive intellectual property, such as proprietary business processes or innovative technologies, may be stolen. This can result in financial losses and a competitive disadvantage for the organization.
Escalation;the process of elevating the incident to higher levels of management or authority within an organization. When a security incident is identified, it may start at a lower level of response, but as the severity or impact of the incident increases, it may be necessary to escalate the matter to higher levels of management, including executives or the incident response team, to ensure appropriate actions are taken.
Public notifications and disclosures;informing the affected individuals, customers, or the general public about the incident. Organizations are often legally obligated to notify individuals whose personal information has been compromised in a data breach. The notifications typically include information about the nature of the breach, the types of data affected, and recommended actions for affected individuals. Public disclosures refer to the communication of information related to a data breach to external parties, such as regulatory bodies, law enforcement, or the media. Depending on the severity and nature of the breach, organizations may be required to disclose specific details to relevant authorities or make public statements to address concerns and maintain transparency.
Public;information that is intentionally made available to the general public. This type of data is not considered confidential and can be freely accessed and shared.
Private;information that is restricted to a specific group or individual and is not publicly disclosed. Access to private data is limited to authorized personnel or entities.
Sensitive;information that, if disclosed or compromised, could result in harm to individuals or the organization. This category may include data that requires special protection due to its nature.
Confidential;information that is intended to be kept secret and is accessible only to authorized individuals or systems. Unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential data may lead to serious consequences.
Critical;information that is deemed essential to the core functions and operations of an organization. The loss, corruption, or unauthorized access to critical data could have a severe impact on the organization's ability to function.
Proprietary;information that is owned by a particular entity or individual and is protected by intellectual property laws. This could include trade secrets, patents, or other forms of exclusive knowledge.
Personally identifiable information (PII);information that can be used to identify and distinguish an individual. This may include names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other identifiers.
Health information;data related to an individual's medical history, conditions, treatments, and other health-related details. The protection of health information is often governed by regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Financial information;encompasses data related to an individual's or organization's financial transactions, accounts, and assets. Protection of financial information is crucial to prevent fraud and unauthorized access.
Government data;information collected, processed, or managed by government entities. It may include public records, classified information, or data related to government operations.
Customer data;information about individuals or entities that have a relationship with a business or organization. This may include contact details, purchase history, and other relevant information.
Data minimization;a privacy principle that involves limiting the collection and processing of personal data to only what is necessary for a specific purpose. By minimizing the amount of data collected and stored, organizations can reduce the risk of privacy breaches and unauthorized access.
Data masking;also known as data obfuscation or pseudonymization, involves replacing, encrypting, or otherwise disguising original data with fake or pseudonymous data. The goal is to protect sensitive information while maintaining the structure and format of the data for testing, analysis, or other legitimate purposes.
Tokenization;a process in which sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personally identifiable information (PII), is replaced with a unique identifier or token. The token has no inherent meaning and cannot be easily reversed to reveal the original data, providing a secure way to handle sensitive information in various systems and processes.
Anonymization;the removal or alteration of personally identifiable information (PII) from data to prevent the identification of individuals. The goal is to make the data anonymous so that it cannot be linked back to specific individuals, thereby protecting privacy.
Pseudo-anonymization;a technique that involves replacing or obscuring personally identifiable information (PII) with artificial identifiers or pseudonyms. Unlike true anonymization, the process may still allow for the re-identification of individuals through additional information or the use of specific keys, but it provides a layer of protection against direct identification.
Data owners;individuals or business units within an organization who have the responsibility for the overall management and protection of specific sets of data. They make decisions regarding the appropriate use, handling, and access controls for the data under their ownership.
Data controller;a legal entity (such as an organization or business) that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which personal data is processed. The data controller is responsible for ensuring that data processing complies with relevant data protection laws and regulations.
Data processor;an entity or person that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller. Data processors carry out specific tasks or operations with the data, as instructed by the data controller. They are bound by contractual agreements to handle the data securely and in compliance with data protection regulations.
Data custodian/steward;responsible for the day-to-day management, protection, and maintenance of specific data sets. They implement the security controls and access policies defined by the data owner and ensure that the data is handled in accordance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
Data protection officer (DPO);a designated person within an organization who is responsible for overseeing data protection and privacy matters. In many jurisdictions, especially under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), certain organizations are required to appoint a DPO. The DPO ensures that the organization complies with data protection laws, conducts risk assessments, and serves as a point of contact for data protection authorities and individuals.
Information life cycle;the stages through which information passes from its creation or acquisition to its disposal or archiving. It typically involves stages such as creation, processing, storage, distribution, and destruction. Managing the information life cycle helps organizations implement appropriate controls, security measures, and compliance with data protection regulations.
Impact assessment;often referred to as a risk impact assessment or privacy impact assessment, is a systematic process for evaluating the potential effects and consequences of a particular event, decision, or project on the privacy and security of personal or sensitive information. Impact assessments help organizations identify and mitigate risks associated with data processing activities.
Terms of agreement;also known as terms of service, terms and conditions, or user agreements, are legal agreements between a service provider and users that outline the rules, rights, and responsibilities governing the use of a particular service or product. These terms typically cover issues such as data usage, privacy policies, intellectual property, and user conduct.
Privacy notice;also known as a privacy policy or data protection notice, is a document provided by an organization to individuals whose personal information is collected and processed. The notice informs individuals about how their data is collected, used, stored, and shared. It often includes details about the purpose of processing, types of data collected, and individuals' rights regarding their data.
