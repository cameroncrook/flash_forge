Key management;Key management involves the generation, storage, distribution, and destruction of cryptographic keys. In the context of PKI, it pertains to managing public and private keys used in asymmetric encryption.
Certificate authority (CA);A Certificate Authority is a trusted organization or entity that issues digital certificates. These certificates verify the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.
Intermediate CA;An Intermediate Certificate Authority is an entity that can issue certificates on behalf of the root CA. It helps in delegating the trust hierarchy, allowing for more flexible and granular control over certificates.
Registration authority (RA);A Registration Authority is an entity responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity making the request before passing it to the CA for approval.
Certificate revocation list (CRL);A CRL is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the CA before their expiration date. Clients can check this list to determine if a certificate is still valid.
Certificate attributes;Certificate attributes provide additional information about the certificate holder, such as name, email address, and organization affiliation.
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP);OCSP is a protocol used to obtain the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. It offers real-time validation instead of relying on periodically updated CRLs.
Certificate signing request (CSR);A CSR is a message sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority requesting a digital certificate. It contains the applicant's public key and other information.
CN;The Common Name is an attribute in a certificate that identifies the entity associated with the public key in the certificate.
Subject alternative name;Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is an extension to the X.509 specification that allows users to specify additional host names or IP addresses for a single SSL certificate.
Expiration;Expiration refers to the validity period of a digital certificate. Certificates have a limited lifespan, after which they must be renewed or replaced to maintain secure communication.
Wildcard;A Wildcard Certificate is a type of SSL/TLS certificate that is used to secure a domain and its subdomains. It uses a wildcard character (*) to secure multiple subdomains under a single certificate.
Subject alternative name;SAN Certificate, also known as Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) or Multi-Domain Certificate, allows multiple domain names to be protected under a single certificate. It's especially useful for securing different domain variations and subdomains.
Code signing;A Code Signing Certificate is used by software developers to digitally sign their applications and software programs. This digital signature verifies the authenticity and integrity of the code, assuring users that it has not been tampered with during download or distribution.
Self-signed;A Self-signed Certificate is a digital certificate that is signed by its own creator rather than a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). While self-signed certificates provide encryption, they do not establish trust, as they are not verified by a third party.
Machine/computer;Machine or Computer Certificates are used to authenticate computers within a network. These certificates are often used for secure communication between machines or devices.
Email;Email Certificates are used to secure email communication, providing encryption and digital signatures to emails, ensuring confidentiality and authenticity of the sender.
User;User Certificates are issued to individual users and are used for various purposes such as authentication, secure access to systems, and digital signatures.
Root;A Root Certificate is a self-signed certificate that is the foundation of trust in a certificate hierarchy. It is used to sign other certificates, creating a chain of trust. Root Certificates are pre-installed in web browsers and operating systems.
Domain validation;Domain Validation (DV) Certificates are basic SSL/TLS certificates that validate the ownership of the domain. They are typically issued quickly and are suitable for personal websites or blogs.
Extended validation;Extended Validation (EV) Certificates provide the highest level of validation and trust. When a website uses an EV certificate, the browser's address bar turns green, indicating that the website has undergone rigorous validation to prove its legitimacy. EV certificates are often used by e-commerce and financial websites to enhance user trust.
Distinguished encoding rules (DER);DER is a binary encoding format for certificates defined in the X.509 standard. It is commonly used for digital certificates and provides a compact way to encode data structures, including public key certificates.
Privacy enhanced mail (PEM);PEM is a widely used format that encodes binary data (including certificates) into ASCII text using base64 encoding. PEM-formatted certificates often have extensions like .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key. They are easy to read and can be used for various types of certificates and private keys.
Personal information exchange (PFX);PFX is a file format used to store a private key with its associated public key certificate and chain of trust. PFX files usually have a .pfx extension and are password-protected to ensure the security of the contained private key.
.cer;The .cer file extension is commonly used for certificates. It can contain certificates in various formats, including DER or PEM. .cer files are usually in binary format and are often used to store X.509 certificates.
P12;P12 is another file format used for storing private keys, certificates, and the certificate chain. P12 files, also known as PKCS#12 files, have a .p12 or .pfx extension and are password-protected. They can store both private and public keys along with the associated certificates.
P7B;P7B files, also known as PKCS#7 files, store certificates and certificate chains without private keys. They are usually in PEM or DER format and have a .p7b or .p7c extension. P7B files are often used to share public key certificates in a secure manner.
Online vs. offline CA;Online CA: An online Certificate Authority (CA) is connected to the network and can respond to certificate requests in real-time. It issues certificates directly to entities requesting them. Offline CA: An offline CA is not connected to the network and operates in a secure, isolated environment. It is used for higher security requirements, such as issuing root certificates or certificates for critical infrastructure. An offline CA is less vulnerable to online attacks but requires manual intervention for certificate issuance.
Stapling;Certificate Stapling, also known as OCSP Stapling, is a technique where the web server includes the OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) response along with the SSL/TLS certificate during the handshake process. This improves the security and performance of SSL/TLS connections by reducing the need for the client to independently check the certificate's revocation status.
Pinning;Certificate Pinning is a security mechanism where a client (such as a web browser) maintains a list of trusted certificates or public keys for specific domains. Pinning ensures that the client only accepts certificates signed by these pre-defined authorities, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
Trust model;A Trust Model defines how trust is established between entities in a networked environment. In the context of PKI, it specifies the rules and procedures for validating digital certificates, establishing the trustworthiness of Certificate Authorities, and ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital communications.
Key escrow;Key Escrow is a process where a trusted third party, often a government agency, holds a copy of cryptographic keys used in secure communications. This is done to ensure that encrypted data can be accessed by authorized entities if necessary, for reasons such as law enforcement or national security.
Certificate chaining;Certificate Chaining refers to the process of validating a digital certificate by verifying its trust chain. A certificate is considered valid if it is signed by a trusted CA or an intermediate CA, and if each CA in the chain can be traced back to a root CA that is pre-installed and trusted by the client's software or operating system.
