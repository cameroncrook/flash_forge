Application approved list;An Application Approved List, also known as an Application Whitelist, is a security feature that allows only approved or authorized applications to run on a system. This is a proactive security measure that helps prevent unauthorized or malicious software from executing on endpoints. The list typically includes trusted applications that have been vetted and deemed safe for use within the organization.
Application blocklist/deny list;On the other hand, an Application Blocklist or Deny List is a security measure that restricts the execution of specific applications. This list includes applications that are considered harmful, unauthorized, or potentially malicious. By maintaining a blocklist, organizations can prevent the launch of known threats and enhance the security of their systems.
Quarantine;Quarantine is a security practice that involves isolating potentially compromised systems or files to prevent the spread of malware or other security threats. When an endpoint security solution detects suspicious activity or a potential threat, it may quarantine the affected files or isolate the affected system. This prevents the threat from spreading to other parts of the network and gives security professionals an opportunity to investigate and remediate the issue.
Firewall rules;Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewall rules define what kind of traffic is allowed or blocked. Configuration changes in firewall rules may involve updating settings to restrict or allow specific types of traffic, ports, or communication protocols based on the organization's security policies.
MDM;Mobile Device Management involves the administration of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets) within an organization. Configuration changes in MDM can include adjusting settings related to device security, access controls, application management, and remote wipe capabilities. This helps ensure that mobile devices used by employees adhere to the organization's security policies.
DLP;DLP solutions are designed to prevent unauthorized access and transmission of sensitive data. Configuration changes in DLP systems may involve specifying rules and policies that control the movement of sensitive data, such as blocking certain file types from being transferred outside the organization's network or applying encryption to sensitive information.
Content filter/URL filter;Content filters and URL filters are components of web security systems. Configuration changes in these filters involve adjusting settings to control access to websites and content. This can include blocking or allowing specific categories of websites, restricting access to certain URLs, and implementing policies to prevent users from accessing malicious or inappropriate content.
Update or revoke certificates;Certificates are used in digital security to establish the identity of entities (e.g., websites, devices) and enable secure communication. Configuration changes related to certificates may involve updating existing certificates to ensure they are using strong encryption algorithms and have not expired. Additionally, if a certificate is compromised or no longer trusted, it may be necessary to revoke it and replace it with a new one.
Isolation;involves separating a system or network from the rest of the environment to prevent the spread of security threats or to contain a compromised system. When a security incident occurs, isolating the affected system or network can help prevent the threat from spreading to other parts of the infrastructure. Isolation is often achieved by physically or logically separating the affected system, restricting its communication with other systems, and limiting its access to resources. This containment measure helps to minimize the potential damage and allows for further investigation and remediation.
Containment;refers to the actions taken to prevent the escalation of a security incident and limit its impact on the overall system or network. Containment measures are implemented to restrict the lateral movement of a threat within the environment. This may involve isolating compromised systems, blocking network communication, or implementing access controls to contain the incident. The goal is to prevent the threat from spreading further while allowing security teams to assess the situation, investigate, and respond effectively.
Segmentation;involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments to control the flow of traffic and limit the impact of security incidents. Network segmentation is a proactive security measure that involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments or zones. Each segment has its own set of security controls, and communication between segments is carefully controlled. In the event of a security incident, segmentation helps contain the threat by limiting its ability to move laterally across the network. Even if one segment is compromised, the segmentation strategy helps prevent the rapid spread of the threat to other parts of the network.
SOAR;SOAR platforms are designed to streamline and automate the processes involved in detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents.
Runbooks;Runbooks are documents or procedures that provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for handling specific tasks or processes. In the context of SOAR, runbooks are often used in incident response to guide security analysts through the necessary steps to investigate and respond to security incidents. These steps can include tasks such as identifying the nature of an incident, collecting relevant information, and executing predefined response actions.
Playbooks;Playbooks are similar to runbooks but are more focused on automation and orchestration. A playbook in a SOAR context is a set of predefined and automated responses to security incidents. It outlines the actions that the SOAR platform should take in response to specific triggers or events. Playbooks can include a series of automated tasks, such as isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, or sending notifications to security personnel. The goal is to reduce response time and human intervention while ensuring a consistent and effective response to security incidents.
