Vulnerability scan output;Vulnerability scanning is a process of identifying and assessing security vulnerabilities in a system or network. The output of a vulnerability scan includes a list of identified vulnerabilities, their severity levels, and recommendations for remediation. Security professionals use this information to address weaknesses in the system and improve overall security.
Sensor;In the context of SIEM, a sensor is a component responsible for collecting and transmitting security-related data. This data can include logs, events, and other information from various sources within an IT infrastructure, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and servers.
Sensitivity;Sensitivity refers to the level of importance or severity assigned to a particular event or alert. In a SIEM system, events are often categorized based on their impact or criticality. Sensitivity settings help prioritize the investigation and response to security incidents.
Trends;SIEM systems can analyze historical data to identify patterns or trends in security events. Understanding trends is valuable for detecting anomalies and potential security threats. For example, a sudden increase in failed login attempts might indicate a brute force attack.
Alerts;Alerts are notifications generated by the SIEM system to inform security personnel about potential security incidents or anomalies. Alerts are triggered based on predefined rules or conditions, such as detecting suspicious network traffic, unauthorized access attempts, or other security-related events.
Correlation;Correlation involves analyzing and combining information from multiple sources to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a security event. SIEM systems use correlation rules to identify relationships between seemingly unrelated events. This helps in distinguishing normal behavior from potentially malicious activities.
Network;These logs capture information related to network activities. They may include details about connections, traffic, and network-level events. Monitoring network logs can help identify unusual or suspicious network behavior.
System;System logs record events and activities on a computer's operating system. This can include information about system startup/shutdown, hardware and software errors, and user login/logout activities. System logs are crucial for understanding the overall health and status of a system.
Application;Application logs contain information about the activities and performance of specific applications running on a system. This may include error messages, user interactions, and application-specific events. Analyzing application logs helps troubleshoot issues and detect anomalies.
Security;Security logs are particularly important for detecting and investigating security-related events. These logs often contain information about login attempts, account modifications, and other security-relevant activities. Security logs play a key role in identifying potential security breaches.
Web;Web logs, also known as access logs, capture information about interactions with web servers. They include details such as website access, user IP addresses, URLs accessed, and response codes. Analyzing web logs can help identify suspicious web traffic or potential attacks.
DNS;DNS (Domain Name System) logs provide information about domain name resolution requests. Monitoring DNS logs is essential for detecting malicious activities, such as domain name hijacking or DNS-based attacks.
Authentication;Authentication logs record information related to user authentication and authorization. This includes login attempts, successful logins, and failed authentication attempts. Authentication logs are critical for identifying unauthorized access attempts.
Dump files;Dump files are created when a program or system crashes. These files contain a snapshot of the system's memory at the time of the crash. Analyzing dump files can help diagnose the cause of system failures and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
VoIP and call managers;VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and call manager logs capture information about voice communication over the network. These logs can include details about calls, call quality, and any issues related to VoIP services.
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic;SIP is a protocol used for initiating, maintaining, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions that involve video, voice, messaging, and other communications applications and services. SIP traffic logs provide insights into communication sessions and can be useful for troubleshooting and security analysis.
syslog/rsyslog/syslog-ng;These are systems and protocols used for logging messages within a network or system. syslog: A standard protocol used to send log messages over a network. It is widely supported by various devices and operating systems. rsyslog: An enhanced version of syslog that provides additional features and capabilities for log message processing and forwarding. syslog-ng: Another alternative to syslog, syslog-ng offers advanced features for log management and message processing.
journalctl;is a command-line utility used to query and display messages from the journal, which is a centralized log system on Linux systems using systemd. It provides a structured and indexed log format, making it easier to filter and analyze log data.
NXLog;NXLog is a cross-platform log management tool that enables the collection, processing, and forwarding of log data. It supports various log formats and protocols, making it a versatile solution for centralizing and managing logs in a networked environment.
Bandwidth monitors;Bandwidth monitors are tools or systems that track and measure the amount of data transmitted over a network. They provide insights into network utilization, helping administrators identify trends, troubleshoot performance issues, and plan for network capacity.
Email;Email metadata includes information about the email itself rather than the content. This can include details such as the sender's and recipient's email addresses, the subject line, date and time of the email, and any attachments. Email metadata is valuable for email management, tracking communication, and investigating potential security incidents.
Mobile;Mobile metadata refers to information associated with mobile device activities. This can include details such as call logs, text message details (sender, recipient, timestamp), location information, and application usage data. Mobile metadata is important for mobile device management, forensic analysis, and tracking user activities.
Web;Web metadata pertains to information related to online activities. This can include details such as the URL of a website, the timestamp of website visits, the user's IP address, and browser information. Web metadata is useful for analyzing user behavior, monitoring web traffic, and investigating potential security threats.
File;File metadata includes information about files stored on a computer or network. This can encompass details such as the file's creation date, last modified date, file size, and the user who created or modified the file. File metadata is crucial for file management, version control, and forensic analysis.
Netflow;NetFlow is a network protocol developed by Cisco that collects and monitors network traffic flow data. It provides detailed information about the source and destination of network traffic, the type of services used, the amount of data transferred, and the duration of each communication. NetFlow is commonly used for bandwidth monitoring, network troubleshooting, and security analysis.
sFlow;sFlow (sampled Flow) is an industry-standard technology for monitoring and collecting network traffic data. Unlike NetFlow, which provides detailed information about every packet, sFlow samples a subset of packets, allowing for more efficient network monitoring. sFlow is often used in high-speed networks where processing all packets may be resource-intensive. It provides information on traffic patterns, top talkers, and network utilization.
IPFIX;IPFIX is a standardized protocol for exporting flow information from network devices. It is similar to NetFlow in that it provides information about network flows, but IPFIX is an IETF standard, making it more vendor-neutral. IPFIX allows for the flexible definition of flow records, making it adaptable to different network environments. It is commonly used for the same purposes as NetFlow, such as network monitoring and security analysis.
Protocol analyzer output;A protocol analyzer (or packet sniffer) is a tool used to capture and analyze data traffic on a network. The output of a protocol analyzer includes details about the communication between devices, such as source and destination addresses, protocols used, and the contents of network packets. This information is valuable for troubleshooting network issues and analyzing network behavior.
