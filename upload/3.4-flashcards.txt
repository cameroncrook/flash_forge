Cryptographic protocols;a set of rules and procedures that ensure secure communication and data protection over a network.
WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2);WPA2 is a security protocol that provides strong data protection and network security for Wi-Fi networks. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol, which is highly secure when configured with a strong passphrase. WPA2 is an improvement over the original WPA (TKIP) protocol and is widely used for securing wireless networks.
WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3);WPA3 is the latest and more secure version of the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol. It enhances wireless security by implementing stronger encryption and authentication methods. WPA3 uses individualized data encryption, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept data transmitted between devices and the Wi-Fi access point.
Counter-mode/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP);CCMP is an encryption protocol used in WPA2 and WPA3. It operates in Counter mode (CTR) for encryption and Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) for data integrity. CCMP ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted over a Wi-Fi network. It provides a high level of security and is resistant to various cryptographic attacks.
Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE);SAE is a key exchange protocol introduced in WPA3. It is used to establish a secure connection between a device and a Wi-Fi network. SAE replaces the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method used in WPA2. SAE is a robust and secure method for authenticating devices without the vulnerabilities associated with some older methods.
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP);EAP is an authentication framework that supports multiple authentication methods. It is commonly used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections. EAP allows for various authentication methods, enabling secure communication between the client (user) and the network server.
Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP);PEAP is an EAP authentication protocol that encapsulates EAP within a TLS encrypted and authenticated tunnel. It provides secure authentication, protecting the EAP conversation between the client and the server from eavesdropping. PEAP is often used in Wi-Fi networks and is considered more secure than EAP alone. Used primarily for Microsoft.
EAP-FAST;EAP-FAST is another EAP authentication protocol designed to enhance security in wireless networks. It creates a secure tunnel between the client and the authentication server, protecting the authentication process. EAP-FAST is particularly useful in scenarios where client certificates are not practical or desired.
EAP-TLS;EAP-TLS is an EAP authentication protocol that uses digital certificates to establish a secure connection between the client and the authentication server. It provides a high level of security by requiring both the client and the server to present valid digital certificates, ensuring mutual authentication and encryption of the communication channel.
EAP-TTLS;EAP-TTLS is an EAP authentication protocol that provides a secure tunnel for client authentication. It allows various methods for the initial authentication, including passwords or token-based methods. EAP-TTLS then establishes a TLS-encrypted tunnel for secure communication between the client and the server.
IEEE 802.1X;IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based Network Access Control (NAC). It provides an authentication framework for controlling access to a network, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can connect to the network. 802.1X is commonly used in wired and wireless networks for secure authentication.
Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) Federation;An authentication service. RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS Federation extends the capabilities of RADIUS by enabling authentication and authorization across multiple domains or organizations, allowing seamless access for users.
Pre-shared key (PSK) vs. Enterprise vs. Open;Pre-shared Key (PSK): PSK is a method of authentication where a passphrase or key is shared between the user (client) and the wireless network. This key is used to establish a secure connection. It is commonly used in home networks and small businesses. While convenient, the security of a PSK network depends heavily on the strength of the passphrase. Enterprise: Enterprise authentication methods involve a more complex and secure process. In enterprise environments, users are often authenticated through a central server using protocols like EAP (such as EAP-TLS or PEAP). This allows for more robust authentication mechanisms, such as digital certificates, smart cards, or other secure methods, ensuring higher security levels than PSK. Open: An open network is a Wi-Fi network that does not use any encryption or authentication methods. It allows any device within range to connect without a password. Open networks are highly discouraged for sensitive or private information due to their lack of security. They are typically used in public places like coffee shops or airports, where users need quick and easy access but should exercise caution regarding the information they access or send.
WiFi Protected Setup (WPS);WPS is a feature that simplifies the process of connecting devices to a secure Wi-Fi network. It allows users to connect devices without entering the Wi-Fi passphrase manually. WPS methods include using a PIN, pushing a button on the router and the device, or using Near Field Communication (NFC) to establish a connection. However, WPS has security vulnerabilities and is often recommended to be disabled, especially in enterprise environments, to prevent unauthorized access.
Captive portals;Captive portals are web pages that users are redirected to when they attempt to connect to a Wi-Fi network. These portals require users to authenticate or agree to terms and conditions before granting access to the internet. Captive portals are commonly used in public Wi-Fi networks (such as hotels or airports) and can provide a layer of security and legal protection for the network provider. Users should be cautious when accessing unknown captive portals to avoid potential security risks.
Site surveys;Site surveys are assessments conducted at the physical location where a wireless network will be installed. They involve analyzing the area to determine the optimal placement of access points, identifying potential sources of interference, and assessing the overall wireless coverage. Site surveys help in designing a network that provides consistent and reliable coverage throughout the intended area.
Heat maps;Heat maps are visual representations of wireless signal strength and coverage areas. They are created using specialized software and help visualize the strength of the Wi-Fi signal in different parts of the surveyed area. Heat maps are valuable tools during the planning phase as they aid in determining the appropriate placement of access points for optimal coverage and performance.
WiFi analyzers;WiFi analyzers are software or hardware tools used to monitor and analyze wireless networks. They provide detailed information about nearby networks, signal strength, channel usage, and interference sources. WiFi analyzers are essential for identifying potential issues, optimizing channel selection, and ensuring minimal interference from neighboring networks.
Channel overlaps;Channel overlaps occur when multiple wireless networks use the same or overlapping channels. Channel overlap can lead to interference, degraded network performance, and reduced throughput. Proper channel planning, based on channel utilization analysis, helps mitigate overlaps and ensures efficient use of available spectrum.
Wireless access point (WAP) placement;WAP placement is critical for achieving optimal coverage and performance. Access points should be strategically positioned to provide even coverage throughout the intended area. Factors such as building layout, obstacles, and user density influence the placement of access points. Site surveys and heat maps are valuable tools for determining the ideal locations for WAP installation.
Controller and access point security;Controller and access point security involves implementing security measures to protect the management interfaces of wireless controllers and access points. This includes using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and keeping firmware/software up to date to address known vulnerabilities. Secure configurations are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential attacks on the wireless infrastructure.
