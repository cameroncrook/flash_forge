Evil twin;A rogue wireless access point that mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network. Attackers create these deceptive networks to trick users into connecting to them, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate their network traffic.
Rogue access point;An unauthorized wireless access point that has been installed on a network without the knowledge or approval of the network administrator. Rogue access points can be used for malicious purposes, including eavesdropping or launching attacks.
Bluesnarfing;The unauthorized access and theft of information (e.g., contacts, messages) from a Bluetooth-enabled device, typically a mobile phone or PDA, using Bluetooth vulnerabilities. It often occurs without the user's knowledge or consent.
Bluejacking;A relatively harmless practice of sending unsolicited messages or business cards to nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. It doesn't involve data theft or intrusion but is more of a nuisance or prank.
Disassociation;A process where a client device voluntarily or involuntarily disconnects from an access point or network. Attackers can sometimes force disassociations to disrupt connectivity.
Jamming;The deliberate interference with wireless communication signals by transmitting radio frequency noise on the same frequency as the target network. This disrupts the network's operation and can lead to denial of service.
Radio frequency identification (RFID);a technology that uses wireless communication to identify and track objects or people using RFID tags and readers. In the context of security, attacks on RFID systems may involve unauthorized access or cloning of RFID tags.
Near-field communication (NFC);A short-range wireless communication technology used for data exchange between devices, such as smartphones and payment terminals. NFC-related security concerns include unauthorized data interception or tampering during communication.
Initialization vector (IV);A random value used in encryption protocols, such as WEP or WPA, to add randomness to the encryption process. Weak or predictable IVs can make encryption vulnerable to attacks.
On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/ man-in-the-browser attack);A type of cybersecurity attack where an attacker intercepts and possibly alters communications between two parties without their knowledge or consent. The attacker positions themselves between the communicating parties and can eavesdrop on or manipulate the data being exchanged. This type of attack can occur in various contexts, such as network communications, web browsing, or secure connections, and poses a significant security risk if not detected and prevented.
Layer 2 attacks;Also known as data link layer attacks, target vulnerabilities in the second layer of the OSI model, which deals with data framing, addressing, and access to the physical medium. These attacks typically exploit weaknesses in Ethernet or other data link layer protocols.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning;Also known as ARP spoofing, is a network attack where an attacker associates their own MAC address with the IP address of another device in the local network. This can lead to traffic redirection, interception, or eavesdropping.
Media access control (MAC) flooding;An attack that floods a network switch with a large number of fake MAC addresses, overwhelming the switch's MAC address table. This can lead to the switch entering "fail-open" mode, potentially allowing unauthorized access to network traffic.
MAC cloning;A technique where an attacker copies the MAC address of a legitimate device and configures their own device to use the same MAC address. This can be used to impersonate the legitimate device on a network, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing network disruptions.
Domain hijacking;Also known as domain theft or domain hijack, is a cyber attack where an attacker gains unauthorized control over a domain name by manipulating the domain registrar's or owner's credentials. The attacker can then redirect the domain's traffic or make changes to its DNS settings.
DNS poisoning;An attack where an attacker corrupts the DNS cache of a DNS server by inserting malicious DNS records. This can lead to incorrect IP address mappings, redirecting users to malicious websites, or intercepting their traffic.
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection;A technique that can be used maliciously to redirect website visitors from one URL to another. Attackers may employ this to trick users into visiting malicious websites or phishing pages.
Domain reputation;Refers to the reputation or trustworthiness associated with a specific domain on the internet. It can be based on various factors, including the domain's history, content, and behavior. Domain reputation is often used by email filters and security tools to assess whether emails from a particular domain are likely to be legitimate or malicious.
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS);A malicious attempt to disrupt the regular functioning of a network, service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources, often through a network of compromised computers (botnet). The goal is to render the target system inaccessible to legitimate users, causing service outages, slowdowns, or disruptions.
