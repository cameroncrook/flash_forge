Legal hold;refers to the process of preserving all relevant information and data that could be used as evidence in a legal case. It ensures that potential evidence is not altered or deleted.
Video;involves the collection and analysis of video recordings as part of a digital forensic investigation. This could include surveillance footage, screen recordings, or any other form of video data.
Admissibility;refers to the acceptability of evidence in a court of law. For digital forensics evidence to be admissible, it must meet certain criteria, such as relevance, reliability, and authenticity.
Chain of custody;the documented and unbroken trail of evidence that establishes its control, handling, and location from the time it is collected until it is presented in court. This helps ensure the integrity and admissibility of the evidence.
Timelines of sequence of events;graphical representations of the chronological order of events in a digital investigation. They help investigators understand the sequence of actions, which is crucial for reconstructing incidents.
Time stamps;metadata that indicate the date and time when a file was created, modified, or accessed. They are essential for establishing the timeline of events during a digital forensic investigation.
Time offset;refers to the adjustment made to synchronize time across different systems or devices. Ensuring accurate time synchronization is crucial for correlating events during an investigation.
Tags;metadata or labels attached to digital evidence to categorize and organize it. They help investigators manage and analyze large volumes of data effectively.
Reports;digital forensics document the findings, methodologies, and conclusions of an investigation. They serve as a formal record and are often presented in court as evidence.
Event logs;records generated by computer systems or applications that document specific events, actions, or errors. Analyzing event logs is crucial for reconstructing the timeline of incidents.
Interviews;involve gathering information from individuals who may have relevant knowledge about an incident. In digital forensics, interviews could be conducted with users, administrators, or anyone involved in the investigation.
Order of volatility;refers to the sequence in which data should be preserved during a digital investigation based on its volatility or likelihood of change. The general principle is to collect volatile data first before less volatile data. For example, data in RAM is more volatile than data on a hard disk.
Disk;involves making a forensic copy of the entire storage device (hard disk or solid-state drive). This ensures that the original evidence remains unaltered during the investigation.
Random-access memory (RAM);involves capturing the contents of a computer's volatile memory. RAM holds data that is actively used by the operating system and running applications. It can provide valuable information about the current state of a system.
Swap/pagefile;involves capturing the contents of the swap space or pagefile on a computer's disk. These areas are used by the operating system to store data that doesn't fit in RAM.
OS;involves collecting information and files related to the operating system, such as system logs, configuration files, and user profiles. This helps investigators understand the system's configuration and activity.
Device;involves capturing data from external devices connected to the system, such as USB drives, external hard disks, or mobile devices. These devices may contain relevant evidence.
Firmware;involves extracting and analyzing the firmware of devices, such as routers, printers, or other embedded systems. Firmware can sometimes be a source of valuable forensic evidence.
Snapshot;involves creating a point-in-time copy or snapshot of a system or storage device. This frozen image can be analyzed without affecting the original data.
Cache;involves capturing data stored in the cache memory of a system or application. Cached data may include recently accessed files or information that can be relevant to an investigation.
Network;involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to understand communication patterns, identify suspicious activities, and gather evidence related to network-based incidents.
Artifacts;traces or remnants of user activities and system events that are left behind on a computer. Examples include browser history, registry entries, and log files. Analyzing artifacts is crucial for reconstructing user actions.
Right-to-audit clauses;contractual provisions that grant an organization the legal right to perform audits or inspections of a service provider's facilities, processes, and records. In the context of digital forensics, having a right-to-audit clause allows an organization to ensure that its data is handled and secured appropriately by a cloud service provider.
Regulatory/jurisdiction;important factors when choosing between on-premises and cloud solutions. Different regions and countries have varying data protection laws and regulations. Understanding the legal requirements and ensuring compliance with relevant jurisdictional laws is crucial in digital forensics to avoid legal complications.
Data breach notification laws;mandate organizations to inform individuals, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders in the event of a data breach. The specific requirements and timelines for notifying affected parties vary by jurisdiction. Digital forensic investigations are often conducted to determine the extent of a data breach and gather evidence for compliance with these laws.
Hashing;a process that takes input data (or a file) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. The output, known as a hash value or hash code, is unique to the input data. In digital forensics, hashing is commonly used to verify the integrity of data. If the data changes, even by a small amount, the hash value will be substantially different.
Checksums;values derived from a mathematical calculation performed on a set of data. Similar to hashing, checksums are used to verify data integrity. If the data changes, the checksum will also change. Checksums are often used in digital forensics to ensure that files or data have not been altered during an investigation.
Preservation;digital forensics refers to the process of protecting and maintaining the integrity of digital evidence to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the investigation. This involves taking steps to prevent accidental or intentional changes to the data, including using write-protected storage media and following proper chain of custody procedures.
E-discovery;the process of identifying, collecting, and preserving electronically stored information (ESI) that may be relevant as evidence in legal cases. It involves the use of technology to search, filter, and analyze large volumes of electronic data, such as emails, documents, and databases, to support legal investigations and litigation.
Data recovery;involves the retrieval of lost, deleted, or corrupted data from storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and other media. In digital forensics, data recovery is often used to recover evidence that may have been intentionally or accidentally deleted by a user.
Non-repudiation;the assurance that a party involved in a communication or transaction cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or the validity of the information they provided. In digital forensics, non-repudiation is important for establishing the accountability of individuals and ensuring the integrity of digital signatures.
Strategic intelligence/ counterintelligence;involve the gathering, analysis, and protection of information related to national security or corporate interests. In the context of digital forensics, these concepts may pertain to the identification and mitigation of cyber threats, including espionage, hacking, and other malicious activities.
