Managerial;focus on the management and oversight of security policies and processes within an organization. More risk management.
Operational;concerned with the day-to-day implementation of security policies and procedures. More about people.
Technical;involve the use of technology to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Technical stuff.
Preventive;are designed to stop or minimize the occurrence of a security incident. Examples: Firewalls: Prevent unauthorized access to a network by blocking or allowing traffic based on predefined security rules, Access Control Lists (ACLs): Restrict access to resources based on predefined rules, Encryption: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by converting it into a secure format.
Detective;are implemented to identify and detect security incidents when they occur. Examples: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor network or system activities for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activities, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems: Collect and analyze log data from various sources to identify security events, Log Analysis: Regularly review and analyze system logs for suspicious activities.
Corrective;are activated after a security incident has been detected to limit the damage and restore the affected systems to normal operation. Examples: Incident Response Plans: Documented procedures to guide the response to and recovery from security incidents, System Backups: Regularly backing up data to facilitate recovery in case of data loss or system compromise, Patch Management: Applying software updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities and improve system security.
Deterrent;are intended to discourage potential attackers or intruders from attempting to compromise security. Examples: Security Guards: Physical presence to deter unauthorized access to a facility, Warning Banners: Displaying banners or messages indicating that unauthorized access is prohibited, Security Cameras: Visible surveillance cameras to deter malicious activities.
Compensating;alternative measures put in place to counterbalance the lack of effectiveness of other controls or to provide an equivalent level of security. Examples: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an additional layer of authentication to compensate for weak passwords, Security Awareness Training: Compensating for the human factor by educating users about security best practices, Redundancy and Failover: Providing backup systems to compensate for potential system failures.
Physical;measures implemented to protect physical assets, such as facilities, equipment, and infrastructure. Examples:
