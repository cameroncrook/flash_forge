Load balancing;Load balancing is a technique used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure no single server is overwhelmed with too much traffic, thereby improving the performance, reliability, and availability of applications or services.
Active/active;In an active/active load balancing setup, all servers in the server farm are active and respond to requests. Each server handles a portion of the incoming traffic. This configuration provides high availability and scalability because if one server fails, the others can still handle the traffic.
Active/passive;In an active/passive configuration, one server (active) handles the incoming traffic while the other server (passive) remains idle, serving as a backup. If the active server fails, the passive server takes over to ensure continuous service. This setup is efficient for backup and disaster recovery.
Scheduling;Round Robin: Requests are distributed in a circular order to servers. Least Connections: Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections. IP Hash: A hash of the client's IP address is used to determine which server receives the request. This ensures that the same client always connects to the same server.
Virtual IP;an IP address that clients use to access the services provided by the load balancer. The load balancer then forwards requests to the appropriate servers in the backend pool. Clients interact with the VIP, unaware of the individual servers handling their requests.
Persistence;(also known as session affinity or sticky sessions) ensures that a client's requests are always directed to the same server in the backend. This is important for applications that require continuous communication with a specific server. Persistence can be based on various factors, such as client IP address, session cookies, or SSL session IDs.
Network segmentation;dividing a computer network into smaller, isolated networks for various purposes, such as security, performance, and management
Virtual local area network (VLAN);A VLAN is a logical network created within a physical network. VLANs enable network administrators to group hosts together in a logical manner, even if they are not physically located on the same network switch. VLANs enhance security and reduce network congestion by isolating traffic within specific segments.
Screened subnet (previously known as demilitarized zone);A screened subnet, commonly known as DMZ, is a network segment that sits between an organization's internal network and an external network (usually the internet). Servers and services that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers and email servers, are placed in the DMZ. It adds an extra layer of security by separating the internal network from potentially untrusted external sources.
East-west traffic;East-west traffic refers to the data flow between servers or devices within the same network or data center. Unlike north-south traffic, which involves communication between clients and servers, east-west traffic occurs between servers. Proper segmentation and security measures are necessary to control and monitor east-west traffic to prevent unauthorized access or lateral movement in case of a security breach.
Extranet;An extranet is a private network that extends over the internet and allows controlled access to specific external users or organizations. It enables secure communication and collaboration between an organization and its external partners, suppliers, or customers. Extranets use security mechanisms like VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to protect data transmission over the internet.
Intranet;An intranet is a private network within an organization that uses internet technologies to share information, collaboration tools, and resources among its employees. Intranets are used to enhance internal communication, share documents, and provide access to corporate databases and applications securely within the organization.
Zero Trust;Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no trust, even among users inside the network perimeter. In a Zero Trust environment, every user and device, whether inside or outside the network, must be verified and authenticated before gaining access to resources. Access control is strictly enforced, and continuous monitoring is performed to detect and respond to security threats promptly.
Virtual private network (VPN);A VPN is a technology that allows secure communication over an insecure network, such as the internet. It creates an encrypted connection between a user's device and a private network, enabling users to access resources, data, and services securely, as if they were directly connected to the private network.
Always-on;Always-on VPN refers to a configuration where the VPN connection is automatically established when a device connects to the internet. This ensures that the user's connection is always encrypted and secure, providing continuous protection against online threats.
Split tunnel vs. full tunnel;Split Tunnel: In a split tunnel VPN configuration, only traffic destined for the private network is sent through the VPN tunnel. Other internet-bound traffic goes directly to the internet without passing through the VPN. Full Tunnel: In a full tunnel VPN configuration, all traffic from the user's device is routed through the VPN tunnel, including both private network-bound and internet-bound traffic. This provides a higher level of security but can impact internet speed due to the additional routing.
Remote access vs. site-to-site;Remote Access VPN: Remote access VPN allows individual users to connect to a private network securely over the internet. It is commonly used by remote workers or employees accessing corporate resources from outside the office. Site-to-Site VPN: Site-to-site VPN enables the secure connection between two or more private networks over the internet. It is often used to connect branch offices to a central corporate network, creating a secure communication channel between geographically dispersed locations.
IPSec (Internet Protocol Security);a suite of protocols used to secure internet communication. It provides encryption, authentication, and integrity protection for IP packets. IPSec can be used in both remote access and site-to-site VPN configurations to ensure secure data transmission over the internet.
SSL/TLS;cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network, commonly used for securing web browsing (HTTPS). SSL VPNs use SSL/TLS protocols to establish secure VPN connections, allowing users to access resources through a web browser securely.
HTML5;HTML5 VPNs use web technologies, such as HTML5, JavaScript, and WebSockets, to establish VPN connections directly within a web browser. HTML5 VPNs don't require additional software installation, making them convenient for users who need secure remote access to network resources.
Layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP);a tunneling protocol that allows the creation of virtual private networks. It doesn't provide encryption on its own; therefore, it is often used in conjunction with IPSec to secure the communication channel. L2TP is commonly used in remote access VPN scenarios.
DNS;DNS is a hierarchical system that translates human-friendly domain names (like ) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. This translation process simplifies the way we access websites and other resources on the internet. DNS is vulnerable to various attacks, such as DNS spoofing, DNS cache poisoning, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To enhance DNS security, technologies like DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) are used. DNSSEC adds a layer of cryptographic signatures to DNS records, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the data provided by DNS servers.
Network access control (NAC);a security technology that ensures only authorized and compliant devices can access a network. It helps organizations maintain the integrity and security of their network infrastructure by enforcing policies and checking the health and compliance of devices seeking access.
Agent and agentless;In agent-based NAC, software agents are installed on end-user devices (such as computers, smartphones, or tablets) seeking access to the network. These agents are responsible for assessing the device's security posture, including checking for up-to-date antivirus software, operating system patches, and other security configurations. Agentless NAC does not require the installation of software agents on end-user devices. Instead, it assesses devices based on their network behavior, traffic patterns, and other attributes without requiring any client-side software.
Out-of-band management;the practice of managing and monitoring network devices using a dedicated management channel that is separate from the production network. In this context, "out-of-band" means that the management traffic does not share the same network infrastructure as the regular user or application data.
Port security;a network security feature that allows administrators to control which devices can access a specific network segment through a switch port. It helps prevent unauthorized devices from gaining network access and enhances overall network security.
Broadcast storm prevention;Broadcast storms occur when excessive broadcast packets flood the network, consuming available bandwidth and causing network congestion. Port security mechanisms can help prevent broadcast storms by limiting the number of devices allowed on a port, thereby reducing the potential for excessive broadcast traffic.
Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard;BPDU Guard is a feature used in spanning tree protocol environments to prevent rogue switches from participating in the spanning tree topology. BPDU Guard automatically disables a port if it receives any BPDU packets, indicating the presence of another switch. This helps prevent loops and maintains the stability of the network.
Loop prevention;Network loops can cause significant disruptions in network communication. Port security features, along with technologies like spanning tree protocols, help prevent loops by detecting and eliminating redundant paths in the network topology. Loop prevention mechanisms ensure that there is a single active path between any two network devices.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping;DHCP snooping is a security feature that prevents unauthorized or malicious DHCP servers from providing incorrect IP configuration information to network devices. DHCP snooping monitors DHCP messages exchanged between clients and servers and ensures that only approved DHCP servers are allowed to assign IP addresses to devices on the network.
Media access control (MAC) filtering;MAC filtering allows network administrators to specify a list of approved MAC addresses for a particular switch port. Only devices with MAC addresses on the approved list are allowed to connect to the network through that port. MAC filtering helps restrict network access to known and authorized devices, enhancing security.
Jump servers;A jump server, also known as a jump host or jump box, is a secure computer that serves as a gateway through which administrators can access other devices within a private network. Instead of allowing direct external access to critical servers and infrastructure, administrators log in to the jump server first and then use it to connect to other internal servers. This adds an additional layer of security by controlling and monitoring access to sensitive systems.
Proxy servers;Proxy servers act as intermediaries between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and the internet. They can enhance security, privacy, and performance in various ways.
Forward;A forward proxy (or simply, a proxy) forwards client requests to servers on the internet. When a client makes a request, it is sent to the forward proxy server, which then processes the request on behalf of the client. Forward proxies can cache web content, block malicious websites, and control access to specific online resources. They are often used in corporate environments to enforce content filtering policies and improve internet performance by caching frequently accessed content.
Reverse;A reverse proxy sits between client devices and web servers, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to the appropriate backend servers. Reverse proxies serve several purposes, such as load balancing, SSL termination (decrypting encrypted traffic), caching, and protecting web servers from direct exposure to the internet. They are commonly used to enhance security, scalability, and performance of web applications and services.
Signature-based;Signature-based detection involves comparing network traffic patterns with pre-defined signatures of known attacks. If the observed traffic matches a signature, the system identifies and alerts or takes action against the detected attack. Signature-based detection is effective against known threats but might struggle with new or previously unseen attacks.
Heuristic/behavior;Heuristic or behavior-based detection focuses on identifying patterns or behaviors that deviate from normal network activity. These systems use algorithms to detect abnormal behaviors that might indicate an attack. Heuristic methods are more adaptive and can identify previously unknown attacks based on their behavior patterns.
Anomaly;Anomaly detection involves establishing a baseline of normal network behavior. Any deviation from this baseline is flagged as potentially malicious. Anomaly-based systems are proficient in detecting previously unknown threats, as they focus on deviations from the norm. However, they might produce false positives if the baseline is not accurately defined.
Inline vs. passive;Inline NIDS/NIPS: Inline systems are placed directly in the network traffic flow and can actively block or modify suspicious traffic in real-time. They can prevent attacks from reaching the target systems but require careful configuration to avoid disrupting legitimate traffic. Passive NIDS/NIPS: Passive systems monitor network traffic passively and generate alerts based on detected threats but do not actively block traffic. Passive systems are used for analysis, forensics, and monitoring purposes. While they don't actively prevent attacks, they provide valuable insights into network security.
HSM;A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical device that provides secure storage and management of cryptographic keys and sensitive data. HSMs are used to perform cryptographic operations, ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, and protect against various attacks, including key theft and tampering. They are often used in applications such as SSL/TLS acceleration, digital signatures, and data encryption.
Sensors;Sensors are devices or components within a network that continuously monitor and collect data related to network traffic, system behavior, or environmental conditions. In a security context, sensors can detect anomalies, intrusions, or potential security threats. These sensors generate data that is analyzed to identify security incidents and trigger alerts or responses.
Collectors;Collectors are components that gather data from various sensors and other sources within a network. They aggregate the collected information, process it, and store it in a centralized location. Collectors play a crucial role in security information and event management (SIEM) systems, where data from multiple sources is collected, normalized, and analyzed to identify security events and incidents.
Aggregators;Aggregators are devices or software components that collect and combine data from multiple sources into a unified view. In the context of network security, aggregators combine data from various sensors, collectors, or other security appliances. They provide a centralized and coherent view of network activity, allowing security professionals to analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to security incidents effectively.
Web application firewall (WAF);A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a specialized firewall that focuses on protecting web applications from various attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web vulnerabilities. WAFs inspect and filter HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet, ensuring the security and integrity of web applications.
NGFW;A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) integrates traditional firewall capabilities with additional security features such as intrusion prevention, application awareness, and advanced threat protection. NGFWs offer enhanced security by inspecting application-layer traffic and applying security policies based on applications, users, and content.
Stateful;A Stateful Firewall monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic. It keeps track of the state of active connections and can make decisions based on the state of the traffic, allowing or blocking packets based on their relation to established connections.
Stateless;A Stateless Firewall filters packets based solely on static criteria such as IP addresses and port numbers. Unlike stateful firewalls, they do not maintain the state of active connections, making decisions solely based on individual packets without considering the context of the traffic.
Unified threat management (UTM);Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliances integrate multiple security features into a single device, offering functions such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention, antivirus, content filtering, and VPN capabilities. UTM solutions provide comprehensive security coverage and simplify network management by consolidating multiple security functions into one device.
Network address translation (NAT) gateway;A NAT Gateway translates private IP addresses to a public IP address, allowing multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address for internet access. NAT gateways enhance security by concealing internal IP addresses from external networks.
Content/URL filter;Content and URL filters block access to specific websites or content categories based on defined policies. These filters are commonly used to enforce internet usage policies within organizations, prevent access to malicious or inappropriate content, and enhance productivity and security.
Open-source vs. proprietary;Open-Source Firewalls are built on open-source software and are customizable and freely available. Proprietary Firewalls, on the other hand, are commercial solutions provided by specific vendors. Both have their advantages and considerations, such as flexibility and support options, which organizations need to evaluate based on their specific requirements.
Hardware vs. software;Hardware Firewalls are standalone devices specifically designed for firewall functionality. Software Firewalls are firewall applications or services that run on general-purpose operating systems. Hardware firewalls often offer dedicated performance, while software firewalls are more flexible but may rely on the host system's resources.
Appliance vs. host-based vs. virtual;Appliance Firewalls: These are physical devices dedicated solely to firewall functions. Host-Based Firewalls: These are software firewalls that run on individual devices (such as computers or servers) and protect the specific host. Virtual Firewalls: These are firewall solutions that run in virtualized environments, providing security for virtual machines and networks within virtualized infrastructures.
Access control list (ACL);Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules that define the permissions and restrictions applied to network resources. ACLs are commonly used in routers, switches, and firewalls to control traffic flow based on criteria such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols. ACLs are used to permit or deny traffic, enhancing security by regulating who can access specific resources in a network.
Route security;Route Security refers to the implementation of security measures to protect the routing infrastructure of a network. This involves ensuring that routing information is accurate, authentic, and reliable. Unauthorized changes to routing tables can lead to traffic interception or redirection, making route security critical to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized network access.
Quality of service (QoS);Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the ability to prioritize certain types of network traffic to ensure a consistent level of performance, particularly in situations where the network is congested. QoS mechanisms prioritize critical data, such as voice and video traffic, over less time-sensitive data, ensuring a better user experience and efficient utilization of network resources.
Implications of IPv6;IPv6, the next-generation Internet Protocol, is designed to address the limitations of IPv4, such as the exhaustion of available IP addresses. Some key implications of IPv6 include: Increased Address Space: IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space, allowing for a practically unlimited number of unique IP addresses. Simplified Header: IPv6 simplifies the packet header structure, improving routing efficiency and reducing processing overhead on network devices. Auto-Configuration: IPv6 supports stateless address auto-configuration, allowing devices to automatically configure their IPv6 addresses without the need for DHCP servers. Security Enhancements: IPv6 includes built-in security features, such as IPsec, which provides authentication and encryption for network communications. Migration Challenges: The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 poses challenges, including coexistence and compatibility issues between IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Various transition mechanisms and technologies have been developed to facilitate this migration.
Port spanning/port mirroring;Port Spanning (also known as Port Mirroring) is a feature found in network switches that allows the traffic passing through one port (or a group of ports) to be copied and sent to another port, known as the monitoring port. This functionality is crucial for network analysis, monitoring, and troubleshooting. When port spanning is configured, the monitoring port acts as a "mirror" that reflects the traffic from the source port(s) without disrupting the original communication.
Port taps;Port Taps are physical devices that serve a similar purpose to port spanning/port mirroring but are external to the network switch. Port taps are used to monitor network traffic non-intrusively. They physically "tap" into the network cable, duplicating the traffic and sending it to a monitoring device for analysis. Port taps are often used in situations where direct access to the switch is limited, or when a completely passive monitoring solution is required.
Monitoring services;Monitoring services refer to the practice of continuously observing and evaluating various aspects of a network, system, application, or service to ensure their optimal performance, security, and availability. Monitoring services involve the use of specialized software tools or platforms that track metrics, analyze patterns, and generate alerts or reports based on predefined thresholds or criteria.
File integrity monitors;File Integrity Monitors (FIM) are security tools that assess the integrity of files and directories on a system by comparing their current state with a baseline or known good state. FIM tools create cryptographic hashes (checksums) of files and regularly check them against the baseline. If a file is modified, added, or deleted, the FIM tool detects the change, providing an early indication of unauthorized or malicious activity.
