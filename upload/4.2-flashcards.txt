Incident response plans;An Incident Response Plan is a documented set of procedures and guidelines to detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents. It outlines the roles, responsibilities, and actions to be taken in the event of a security incident to minimize damage and reduce recovery time and costs.
Preparation;This phase involves activities conducted before an incident occurs to ensure that an organization is ready to respond effectively. Tasks may include developing an incident response plan, establishing an incident response team, providing training and awareness, and implementing technologies and tools for incident detection and response.
Identification;In this phase, the goal is to detect and identify security incidents as soon as possible. This involves monitoring systems and networks for signs of unusual or malicious activity, using intrusion detection systems, security information and event management (SIEM) tools, and other monitoring mechanisms.
Containment;Once an incident is identified, the next step is to contain it to prevent further damage. Containment measures involve isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, and implementing controls to stop the spread of the incident within the network.
Eradication;The eradication phase focuses on completely removing the cause of the incident from the affected systems. This may involve patching vulnerabilities, removing malware, and closing security holes to ensure that the incident cannot recur.
Recovery;After eradicating the incident, the organization works on restoring affected systems and services to normal operation. This includes restoring data from backups, verifying the integrity of systems, and conducting thorough testing to ensure that restored systems are secure and functional.
Lessons learned;The final phase involves analyzing the incident response process and the incident itself to identify areas for improvement. Organizations conduct a post-incident review to understand what worked well, what could be done better, and how to enhance the incident response capabilities for the future.
Exercises;refers to planned activities designed to test and enhance an organization's ability to respond effectively to security incidents.
Tabletop;a discussion-based, interactive activity where key stakeholders gather to simulate a hypothetical security incident in a relaxed, informal setting. Process: Participants discuss and talk through the actions they would take in response to the simulated incident. This exercise is typically led by a facilitator who introduces scenarios and guides the discussion. Purpose: Tabletop exercises help identify gaps in the incident response plan, clarify roles and responsibilities, and improve coordination among team members. They are useful for testing the decision-making process and communication strategies.
Walkthroughs;involve a step-by-step review of the incident response plan or specific procedures with the team. Process: Team members review the plan together, discussing each step and ensuring that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. This is a more detailed and focused examination compared to a tabletop exercise. Purpose: Walkthroughs help validate the clarity and effectiveness of the incident response plan, ensuring that all team members have a deep understanding of their tasks and responsibilities.
Simulations;more hands-on and involve actively practicing the steps of the incident response plan in a controlled environment. Process: The organization creates a scenario that closely simulates a real incident, and the incident response team goes through the entire response process as if it were a genuine event. This can include deploying technical tools, interacting with simulated stakeholders, and making decisions in real-time. Purpose: Simulations provide a more realistic test of the incident response capabilities, allowing the team to practice their technical skills, coordination, and decision-making under conditions that closely mimic a real incident. They help identify weaknesses and areas for improvement in a more dynamic way than tabletop exercises or walkthroughs.
MITRE ATT&CK;a knowledge base that describes the actions and behaviors of cyber adversaries. It provides a comprehensive and detailed mapping of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use across different stages of the attack lifecycle. Structure: ATT&CK is organized into matrices that represent various platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and mobile, detailing how adversaries might operate on each platform. It covers a wide range of topics, including initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and impact. Use: Security professionals use ATT&CK to understand, analyze, and enhance their defenses by aligning them with known adversary tactics. It helps in threat intelligence, detection, and response strategies.
The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis;a conceptual framework that aids in the analysis of cyber intrusions by breaking down the elements involved in an attack. It was developed to enhance the understanding of cyber threat intelligence. Elements: The Diamond Model consists of four key elements: Adversary, Infrastructure, Victim, and Capability. These elements are interconnected to represent the relationships between the attacker, the tools and infrastructure used, the targeted victim, and the capabilities deployed in the attack. Use: Security analysts use the Diamond Model to analyze and visualize the relationships between these elements, helping them understand the tactics and motivations of cyber adversaries. It assists in identifying patterns and improving defenses against similar attacks.
Cyber Kill Chain;a model that describes the stages of a cyber attack, from the initial reconnaissance to the final objective. It was developed by Lockheed Martin and is structured as a series of stages that an attacker typically goes through. Stages: The typical stages of the Cyber Kill Chain include Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, Actions on Objectives. Use: The Cyber Kill Chain helps organizations understand the progression of an attack, allowing them to develop strategies and defenses at each stage. It assists in threat detection, incident response, and the development of security measures to disrupt the attacker's progress.
Stakeholder management;In the context of incident response, stakeholders are individuals or groups with an interest in the organization's security and well-being. Stakeholder management involves identifying, communicating with, and involving relevant parties such as executives, legal teams, and public relations during and after a security incident.
Communication plan;A Communication Plan outlines how information is shared internally and externally during and after a security incident. It includes protocols for notifying the incident response team, stakeholders, and the public, as well as managing internal communications to avoid misinformation.
Disaster recovery plan;A Disaster Recovery Plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the steps and procedures to recover and restore IT systems and data after a disruptive event, such as a natural disaster or a cyber attack.
Business continuity plan;A Business Continuity Plan focuses on the organization's ability to maintain essential functions and services during and after a disaster or incident. It addresses business processes, personnel, facilities, and technology to ensure the organization can continue its critical operations.
Continuity of operations planning (COOP);COOP is a broader concept that encompasses both Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. It ensures that an organization can continue its essential functions and services during a wide range of disruptions.
Incident response team;The Incident Response Team is a group of individuals responsible for implementing the incident response plan. Team members have specific roles and responsibilities, such as detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and communication during a security incident.
Retention policies;Retention policies govern the storage duration and disposal of data, including logs and incident-related information. These policies ensure that necessary data is retained for compliance and investigative purposes while minimizing the risk associated with keeping unnecessary data.
