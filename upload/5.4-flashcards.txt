External;threats and vulnerabilities that originate from outside the organization. These can include cyberattacks, natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and other external factors that may impact the security and continuity of the organization.
Internal;threats and vulnerabilities that arise from within the organization itself. This could involve employee actions, unintentional mistakes, or internal processes that may compromise security. Examples include insider threats, human errors, and inadequate security policies.
Legacy systems;refers to the security challenges associated with older technology and systems that may no longer be supported or updated. These systems often have known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
Multiparty;the potential security threats that arise when multiple parties are involved in business processes. This can include risks associated with third-party vendors, business partners, and other entities that interact with the organization.
IP theft;the unauthorized acquisition or use of a company's intellectual property, such as patents, trade secrets, or proprietary information. This can result in financial losses and a competitive disadvantage for the affected organization.
Software compliance/licensing;the challenges of ensuring that an organization is using software in accordance with the terms and conditions set by the software vendors. Non-compliance can lead to legal issues and financial penalties.
Acceptance;a risk management strategy where the organization acknowledges the existence of a risk and decides not to take any specific action to avoid or mitigate it. This strategy is typically chosen when the cost of addressing the risk is higher than the potential impact, and the organization is willing to bear the consequences.
Avoidance;a risk management strategy that involves taking steps to eliminate or withdraw from activities, processes, or situations that pose a high level of risk. The goal is to completely avoid the potential negative consequences associated with a particular risk.
Transference;a risk management strategy that involves shifting the impact or responsibility of a risk to a third party. This is often done through mechanisms like insurance or outsourcing. By transferring the risk, the organization aims to mitigate the financial or operational impact of the risk.
Cybersecurity insurance;a risk management strategy where organizations purchase insurance policies to provide financial protection in the event of a cyber-related incident. These policies may cover costs associated with data breaches, business interruptions, and other cyber risks.
Mitigation;a risk management strategy focused on reducing the impact or likelihood of a risk. This can involve implementing security controls, conducting regular security training, and adopting best practices to minimize the vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
Risk register;a documented record that includes information about identified risks, their characteristics, and the steps planned or taken to address them. It typically includes details such as the nature of the risk, potential impact, likelihood, and assigned responsibilities for managing the risk.
Risk matrix/heat map;a visual representation of risks that helps organizations prioritize and understand the potential impact and likelihood of each risk. It often uses colors to indicate the level of risk, with high-risk items being highlighted for attention.
Risk control assessment;evaluating the effectiveness of existing controls in place to manage and mitigate identified risks. This assessment helps determine whether the controls are adequate or if additional measures are needed.
Risk control self-assessment;a process where individuals or teams within an organization assess the effectiveness of risk controls related to their specific responsibilities. This can provide a decentralized approach to risk management, involving those closest to the processes and activities.
Risk awareness;the level of understanding and consciousness within an organization regarding potential risks. It involves educating and informing individuals at all levels about the nature of risks, their impact, and the role each person plays in managing them.
Inherent risk;the level of risk present in a system or process without considering any mitigating controls. It represents the natural level of risk before any risk management actions are taken.
Residual risk;the level of risk that remains after risk mitigation or control measures have been implemented. It represents the ongoing risk that the organization is willing to accept.
Control risk;the risk that arises from the potential failure of internal controls to adequately address and manage identified risks. It is a component of overall risk and is considered when evaluating the effectiveness of risk management strategies.
Risk appetite;the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It is a strategic decision that guides the organization in determining the balance between risk-taking and risk-avoidance.
Regulations that affect risk posture;These are regulatory requirements and standards that impact the risk posture of an organization. Compliance with these regulations is essential for managing risks associated with legal and industry-specific requirements.
Qualitative;an approach to risk analysis that focuses on subjective evaluations of risks. It involves identifying and prioritizing risks based on their perceived impact and likelihood, often using descriptive scales (such as low, medium, high) rather than precise numerical values. Qualitative risk assessments are valuable when precise data is unavailable or difficult to quantify.
Quantitative;a method that involves the numerical analysis and measurement of risks. This approach assigns specific values to factors such as the probability of an event occurring, the potential impact of the event, and the cost associated with the impact. Quantitative risk assessment provides a more quantitative and numeric understanding of risks, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions and prioritize risk management efforts based on calculated probabilities and potential losses.
Likelihood of occurrence;the probability or chance that a specific risk event will happen within a given time frame. It is often expressed as a percentage or a qualitative scale (e.g., low, medium, high).
Impact;the potential harm or negative consequences that may result from a risk event occurring. Impact is often assessed in terms of financial loss, operational disruption, reputational damage, or other relevant factors.
Asset value;the estimated worth or value of an organizational asset. Assets can include physical assets (such as equipment or buildings), information assets (such as data and intellectual property), and other resources that are critical to the organization.
Single-loss expectancy (SLE);a quantitative measure that represents the expected financial loss resulting from a single occurrence of a specific risk event. It is calculated by multiplying the asset value by the likelihood of occurrence.
Annualized loss expectancy (ALE);a measure that estimates the expected financial loss from a specific risk over the course of a year. It is calculated by multiplying the Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE) by the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).
Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO);a measure that estimates the frequency with which a specific risk event is expected to occur within a year. It is often expressed as a decimal or a percentage. The ARO is a key component in the calculation of the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE).
Environmental;catastrophic events that result from natural forces or processes. These can include events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other natural phenomena that cause significant damage to the environment and pose threats to human life and property.
Person-made;catastrophic events that result from human actions or negligence. Examples include industrial accidents, transportation accidents, chemical spills, nuclear incidents, and other events caused by human activities that lead to widespread harm and damage.
Internal vs. external;Internal disasters refer to events that occur within the boundaries or infrastructure of an organization. These could include incidents like fires within a building, power outages, or other disruptions that affect the internal operations of the organization. External disasters are events that originate outside the organization but have the potential to impact its operations. This can include natural disasters, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, and other external factors that can affect the organization's ability to function.
Recovery time objective (RTO);the targeted duration within which a business process or system must be restored after a disruption to avoid unacceptable consequences. It represents the maximum allowable downtime for a specific function or process.
Recovery point objective (RPO);the maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost due to a disruption. It indicates the point in time to which systems and data must be recovered after an outage or disaster.
Mean time to repair (MTTR);the average time it takes to repair a failed system or component and restore it to normal operation after a failure.
Mean time between failures (MTBF);the average time elapsed between the occurrences of failures in a system or component. It is a measure of the reliability of a system.
Functional recovery plans;outline the specific steps and processes required to restore and resume the operations of critical business functions after a disruption. These plans are part of the overall business continuity strategy.
Single point of failure;a component or part of a system whose failure could lead to the failure of the entire system. Identifying and mitigating SPOFs is critical in building resilient systems.
Disaster recovery plan (DRP);a documented and structured approach outlining the processes, policies, and procedures for recovering and restoring IT systems and data after a disaster or disruption.
Mission essential functions;the critical activities or operations that an organization must perform to fulfill its core mission and responsibilities. Identifying MEFs is crucial for prioritizing resources during a disruption.
Identification of critical systems;recognizing and documenting the IT systems and applications that are essential for the organization's core functions. These systems are prioritized for recovery in the event of a disruption.
Site risk assessment;evaluating and documenting the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the physical locations (sites) where an organization operates. This assessment is part of the overall risk management and business continuity planning process.
