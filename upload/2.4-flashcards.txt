Directory services;software applications or systems that store, organize, and provide access to information in a directory. In the context of authentication, directory services store user credentials (such as usernames and passwords) and manage user access to network resources.
Federation;the process of establishing a trust relationship between multiple domains or organizations, allowing users from one domain to access resources or services in another domain without the need for separate authentication. It enables single sign-on (SSO) capabilities across different systems and platforms.
Attestation;the process of verifying the authenticity and integrity of a device, system, or user. In authentication, attestation can involve confirming the trustworthiness of a device or user's identity claims. For example, attestation methods can be used to ensure that a device trying to connect to a network is genuine and secure.
Time-based one- time password (TOTP);a time-based authentication method that generates temporary one-time passwords using a shared secret key and the current time. These passwords are typically valid for a short period, usually 30 seconds, and are commonly used for two-factor authentication (2FA) in online services and applications.
HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP);a HMAC-based authentication method that generates one-time passwords using a shared secret key and a counter value. Each time a password is used, the counter value is incremented. HOTP passwords remain valid until used and are often used in hardware tokens for two-factor authentication.
Short message service (SMS);sending one-time passwords or authentication codes to users via text messages on their mobile phones. Users receive the code through SMS, which they then enter into the application or website to verify their identity.
Token key;a unique and secret cryptographic key used in authentication tokens (hardware or software) to generate one-time passwords. This key is essential for generating and validating the passwords in authentication processes.
Static codes;fixed, unchanging authentication codes that are pre-generated and provided to users. Unlike dynamic one-time passwords, static codes do not change with time or use and are used for specific, often temporary, authentication purposes.
Authentication applications;software-based tools installed on smartphones or other devices. These apps generate one-time passwords or codes for authentication purposes. Examples include Google Authenticator and Authy.
Push notifications;sending a notification to a user's mobile device, prompting them to approve or deny a login attempt. Users can verify their identity by simply acknowledging the notification, enhancing security and user experience.
Phone call;receiving an automated phone call that delivers a spoken verification code to the user. The user enters this code into the system to confirm their identity, providing an alternative method for two-factor authentication.
Smart card authentication;using a smart card, which is a small electronic device containing embedded integrated circuits, to verify a user's identity. Smart cards store digital certificates or authentication credentials and require users to insert the card into a card reader and enter a PIN to access secure systems or services. This method enhances security by providing two-factor authentication (something the user has - the smart card, and something the user knows - the PIN).
Biometrics;the measurement and statistical analysis of people's unique physical and behavioral characteristics. In the context of authentication and security, biometric systems are used to identify or verify the identity of individuals based on these distinctive traits.
Fingerprint;scanning and analyzing the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on an individual's fingertips. Fingerprint recognition is widely used for personal identification due to the distinctiveness and uniqueness of each person's fingerprints.
Retina;capturing the unique patterns of blood vessels located at the back of the eye. Retinal scans are highly accurate and are used in specialized security applications.
Iris;captures the unique patterns in the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil. Iris recognition systems use these patterns for identifying individuals, providing a high level of accuracy and security.
Facial;analyzes facial features, such as the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline, to identify or verify individuals. Facial recognition technology is widely used in various applications, including smartphone unlocking and airport security.
Voice;analyzes the unique vocal patterns, tone, and speech characteristics of individuals. Voice recognition systems are used for speaker verification and authentication purposes.
Vein;scans the unique patterns of veins, usually in the palm or finger, using infrared light. Vein patterns are unique to individuals and remain stable over time, making vein recognition systems highly accurate.
Gait analysis;studying an individual's walking pattern, including the rhythm, pace, and other traits. It is used for biometric identification based on the way a person walks.
Efficacy rates;the overall accuracy and effectiveness of a biometric system. These rates include metrics such as accuracy, precision, and reliability in identifying or verifying individuals.
False acceptance;the system incorrectly identifies an unauthorized person as an authorized user, granting access to someone who should not have it.
False rejection;when a biometric system fails to recognize an authorized user, denying access to someone who should have been granted access.
Crossover error rate;a metric used to compare the performance of different biometric systems. It represents the point at which the rates of false acceptance and false rejection are equal, indicating the system's overall accuracy. Lower CER values indicate better performance.
Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA);Authentication verifies the identity of users, systems, or devices attempting to access a network or application. Authorization determines what actions authenticated users, systems, or devices are allowed to perform. It involves granting or denying specific privileges and permissions based on the authenticated identity. Accounting involves tracking and monitoring user activities, such as logins, data access, and system operations. It helps in creating audit trails and ensuring accountability for actions performed within a system.
