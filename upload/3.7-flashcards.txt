Identity provider (IdP);An Identity Provider is a system or service that authenticates and manages user identities. It issues authentication tokens to users after they successfully log in, allowing them to access different resources or services without the need to log in again.
Attributes;Attributes are pieces of information associated with a user's identity, such as name, email address, role, permissions, and other characteristics. Attributes provide additional context about a user and help in making access control decisions.
Certificates;Certificates are digital documents that verify the identity of an entity, such as a person, website, or organization. They are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) and are used in various security protocols like SSL/TLS to ensure secure communication and validate the authenticity of parties involved.
Tokens;Tokens are small pieces of data that authenticate users and provide access to specific resources. There are different types of tokens, such as access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens, used in authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Tokens help in secure data exchange between parties without exposing sensitive information like passwords.
SSH keys;SSH (Secure Shell) keys are cryptographic keys used for secure remote access to systems over a network. SSH keys come in pairs: a public key (which is shared with others) and a private key (which is kept secret). When someone attempts to connect to a system, the public and private keys are used to establish a secure connection without transmitting sensitive information like passwords over the network.
Smart cards;Smart cards are physical devices resembling credit cards that contain an embedded microprocessor and memory. They are used for secure authentication and storage of digital certificates, private keys, and other sensitive information. Smart cards provide an additional layer of security by requiring physical possession of the card and often a PIN or biometric verification to access the stored information.
User account;A user account is a personal account created for an individual user. It allows the user to log into a computer system, network, or application with a unique username and password. User accounts are typically used for personalized access, and each user has their own set of permissions and settings.
Shared and generic accounts/credentials;Shared and generic accounts/credentials are accounts or login information that multiple users share. These accounts are often used in situations where several people need access to the same resources without having individual accounts. While convenient, shared accounts can pose security risks because it's challenging to track who accessed the system and performed specific actions. Best security practices discourage the use of shared accounts whenever possible.
Guest accounts;Guest accounts are accounts created for temporary or occasional users who need limited access to a system. Guest accounts are often used in public places, such as hotels or cafes, to provide internet access without granting full access to the local network. These accounts typically have restricted privileges to maintain security and privacy.
Service accounts;Service accounts are used by applications, services, or systems to interact with other software components. These accounts are designed for automation and are often used to run background services, scheduled tasks, or specific processes without human intervention. Service accounts are configured with the necessary permissions to perform their designated tasks and are crucial for the efficient functioning of various software systems.
Password complexity;Password complexity policies enforce rules regarding the strength of user passwords. These rules may include requirements for minimum length, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance password security.
Password history;Password history policies prevent users from reusing old passwords. This ensures that users don't rotate back to previously compromised or easily guessable passwords.
Password reuse;Password reuse policies prevent users from using the same password for multiple accounts or systems. This practice enhances security by minimizing the impact if one account is compromised.
Network location;Network location policies define access permissions based on the user's location within a network. Users may have different levels of access when connecting from inside the corporate network compared to accessing resources remotely.
Geofencing;Geofencing is a technology that uses GPS or RFID to create virtual boundaries around a physical location. Geofencing policies can restrict or allow access based on a user's geographical location.
Geotagging;Geotagging refers to the addition of geographical information, such as GPS coordinates, to media like photos or videos. Geolocation refers to determining the physical location of a device or user. Both these technologies can be used for access control based on the user's specific geographic location.
Geolocation;Geolocation refers to determining the physical location of a device or user.
Time-based logins;Time-based login policies restrict user access to specific time periods. For example, users may be allowed to log in only during business hours, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access during non-working hours.
Access policies;Access policies define the rules and permissions regarding which users or systems can access specific resources or perform certain actions. Access policies ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access the resources they need and nothing more.
Account permissions;Account permission policies determine what actions or operations a user can perform within a system or application. Permissions are assigned based on roles and responsibilities to maintain the principle of least privilege, limiting user access to the minimum necessary for their tasks.
Account audits;Account audits involve regularly reviewing and monitoring user account activities to identify any suspicious or unauthorized behavior. Auditing helps in maintaining the security and integrity of user accounts and the overall system.
Impossible travel time/risky login;Impossible travel time or risky login policies detect and flag suspicious logins from locations that would be impossible to reach in the given time frame. These policies help identify potential security threats, such as unauthorized access attempts or compromised accounts.
Lockout;Lockout policies involve temporarily disabling a user account after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts. Lockout mechanisms help protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts.
Disablement;Disablement policies involve permanently or temporarily disabling user accounts when they are no longer needed or when there are security concerns. Disabled accounts cannot be used to log in or access resources.
