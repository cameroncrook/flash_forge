Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC);an extension to DNS that adds a layer of security by signing the DNS data with cryptographic signatures. It helps in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS data.
SSH;a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over a non-secure network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by encrypting the data during transmission.
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME);a standard for public key encryption and signing of MIME data. It is commonly used to secure email communications by encrypting the content and authenticating the sender.
Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP);a security framework that provides confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection for real-time transport protocols like VoIP (Voice over IP) and video conferencing.
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over SSL (LDAPS);a secure version of LDAP, a protocol used for accessing and managing directories. LDAPS encrypts the data transmitted between the LDAP client and server using SSL/TLS.
File Transfer Protocol, Secure (FTPS);an extension of FTP that adds support for the TLS and SSL cryptographic protocols. It enables secure file transfer over a network.
SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP);a secure file transfer protocol that provides secure file access, transfer, and management functionalities over a reliable data stream.
Simple Network Management Protocol, version 3 (SNMPv3);a protocol used for managing and monitoring network devices. SNMPv3 introduces security features like authentication and encryption to protect the integrity and confidentiality of SNMP messages.
Hypertext transfer protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS);the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used for transmitting data on the internet. It adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS to secure the communication between the client and the server.
IPSec;a suite of protocols used to secure internet protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a communication session.
Authentication header (AH)/ Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP);protocols used in IPSec. AH provides authentication and integrity without confidentiality, while ESP provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality for IP packets.
Tunnel/transport;These are modes in IPSec. Tunnel mode encrypts and/or authenticates the entire IP packet and is used for secure communication between networks. Transport mode encrypts and/or authenticates only the data payload and is used for host-to-host communication.
Post Office Protocol (POP)/ Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP);email retrieval protocols. POP downloads emails from the server to the client device, whereas IMAP allows emails to be viewed and manipulated directly on the server.
Voice and video;Secure protocols like Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and protocols used in Voice over IP (VoIP) systems ensure the confidentiality and integrity of voice and video communications over the network.
Time synchronization;Protocols such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) are used to synchronize clocks across computer systems. Ensuring these protocols are secure prevents malicious entities from manipulating time-sensitive data or events.
Email and web;Secure protocols like HTTPS (for web) and S/MIME (for email) provide encryption and authentication, ensuring the security of data transmitted via email and web services.
File transfer;Secure protocols like FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) ensure secure and encrypted file transfers over networks, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access during transit.
Directory services;LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS) are used for accessing and managing directory information services. Secure implementations (like LDAPS) ensure confidentiality and integrity of directory data.
Remote access;Protocols like SSL VPN (Secure Socket Layer Virtual Private Network) and IPsec VPN (Internet Protocol Security Virtual Private Network) enable secure remote access to corporate networks, protecting data transmission over untrusted networks.
Domain name resolution;DNS and DNSSEC are protocols used for domain name resolution. DNSSEC adds security features to DNS by signing the data, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses, thereby preventing DNS spoofing attacks.
Routing and switching;While routing and switching are fundamental networking concepts, secure routing protocols (e.g., BGPsec for Border Gateway Protocol) are employed to ensure the security and integrity of routing information, preventing route hijacking and other attacks.
Network address allocation;DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is commonly used for network address allocation. While DHCP itself doesn’t provide encryption, it’s essential to configure it securely to prevent unauthorized IP address assignments.
Subscription services;Subscription services often require secure authentication and payment mechanisms. Secure protocols such as HTTPS, ensuring encrypted data transmission, are employed to protect user data during subscription transactions.
