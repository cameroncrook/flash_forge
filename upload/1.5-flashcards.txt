Insider threats;they really have two different motivations. There's one group that's gonna be all about aggrievance, perhaps they were passed over for a promotion or they didn't get the pay raise that they were expecting. They're unhappy, they're out for revenge. Or there might be a perceived morality, maybe they think the company has done something wrong, something that needs to be exposed or fixed and they've gone up the chain of command and perhaps gotten either poo-pooed or just totally ignored. So they feel it's incumbent upon them to take action. Resource and sophistication, medium to low, depending on who they are. And our competitors, well, our competitors might be out for espionage. Maybe they wanna learn what our company is up to, maybe they're trying to steal some intellectual property or disruption. Perhaps they wanna knock us offline or put us out of business. Resources and sophistication, medium to high
State actors;They may want to sow unrest or discord within their country or in another country or perhaps they wanna get a tactical advantage or they wanna learn something about another country, maybe military secrets. Resources and sophistication, very, very high.
Hacktivists;Individuals or groups who engage in hacking activities to promote a political or social cause. They use their hacking skills to raise awareness or advance their beliefs, often by defacing websites or disrupting online services.

Hackers;Broadly, individuals with technical expertise who use their skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. This term can encompass ethical hackers (white hat hackers) who help protect systems and malicious hackers (black hat hackers) who engage in cybercrime.
Authorized;a security practitioner or hobbyist whose motivation is to identify security vulnerabilities and exploits and responsibly disclose them to a manufacturer or a client organization. And the key here is responsibly disclose and that they're always acting with permission.
Unauthorized;individuals whose motivation is to identify security vulnerabilities and exploits for personal or for financial gain.
Semi-authorized;individuals whose motivation is to identify security vulnerabilities and exploits for a reward or for recognition. Now the research is generally conducted without permission and they may publicly disclose the vulnerabilities if the entity doesn't respond in line with their expectations.
Shadow IT;The use of unauthorized software, devices, or services within an organization without the knowledge or approval of the IT department. It can pose security risks because it operates outside the established security and compliance protocols.
Competitors;In the context of cybersecurity, this refers to other companies or organizations within the same industry who may pose a threat by attempting to steal sensitive business information, trade secrets, or intellectual property through cyberattacks. This can include corporate espionage and industrial espionage activities.
Internal/external;Internal Threat Actor: A threat actor who is or was associated with the organization being targeted. This can include employees, contractors, or anyone with insider knowledge. External Threat Actor: A threat actor who has no direct affiliation with the organization and operates from outside. This category includes hackers, cybercriminals, and other external entities.
Level of sophistication/capability;Sophistication: Refers to the expertise, knowledge, and technical skill of a threat actor. Highly sophisticated actors possess advanced skills, while less sophisticated actors may rely on simpler attack methods. Capability: The overall ability of a threat actor to carry out cyberattacks successfully. This includes not only technical skills but also access to resources and tools.
Resources/funding;Resources: The assets, tools, and infrastructure that a threat actor can leverage for cyberattacks. This can include access to botnets, zero-day exploits, or other hacking tools. Funding: The financial backing available to a threat actor to support their cyber operations. Well-funded threat actors may have more resources at their disposal, enabling larger and more sophisticated attacks.
Intent/motivation;Intent: The ultimate goal or objective of a threat actor's actions. This can include financial gain, information theft, disruption of services, or other malicious purposes. Motivation: The underlying reasons or driving forces behind a threat actor's actions. Motivations can vary widely and may include financial profit, ideological beliefs, revenge, espionage, or political agendas. Understanding motivation is crucial for cybersecurity analysis and defense strategies.
Vectors;a method or pathway used by an attacker to access or penetrate a target system or environment.
Direct access;An attack vector where an attacker physically accesses a computer, network, or device to compromise its security. This can involve unauthorized entry to a facility, tampering with hardware, or stealing devices.
Wireless;An attack vector that exploits vulnerabilities in wireless communication protocols, networks, or devices. This can include Wi-Fi hacking, Bluetooth exploits, or attacks against other wireless technologies.
Email;An attack vector that involves sending malicious emails to target individuals or organizations. Email attacks can include phishing, malware attachments, and social engineering tactics to deceive recipients.
Supply chain;An attack vector that targets an organization's suppliers, vendors, or partners to compromise the security of the target organization indirectly. Attackers may inject malware or manipulate the supply chain process.
Social media;An attack vector that leverages social media platforms to gather information about targets, distribute malware, conduct phishing campaigns, or manipulate public opinion through fake accounts and disinformation.
Removable media;An attack vector involving the use of external storage devices such as USB drives or CDs/DVDs to introduce malware or unauthorized data into a computer or network when the media is connected.
Cloud;An attack vector targeting cloud computing infrastructure, services, or data. Attackers may exploit misconfigurations, weak access controls, or vulnerabilities in cloud platforms to compromise data or disrupt services hosted in the cloud.
Open-source intelligence (OSINT);Intelligence gathered from publicly available sources, such as news articles, social media, websites, and other open data. OSINT provides information about potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Closed/proprietary;Sources of threat intelligence that are not publicly accessible and are typically owned or controlled by specific organizations or government agencies. They contain sensitive or restricted information
Vulnerability databases;Repositories that catalog known software vulnerabilities, including their descriptions, severity levels, and patches. Examples include the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.
Public/private information- sharing centers;Organizations or platforms where public and private entities share threat intelligence, incident data, and best practices to enhance collective cybersecurity.
Dark web;A part of the internet that is intentionally hidden and accessible only through specialized software. It often hosts illegal activities, including the exchange of hacking tools, stolen data, and criminal services.
Indicators of compromise;Pieces of data or evidence that suggest a security incident has occurred. IoCs can include IP addresses, file hashes, domain names, or patterns of suspicious behavior.
Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS);A system for automated sharing of threat indicators among organizations or between public and private sectors. It facilitates real-time threat information exchange.
Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)/Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII);Standards and protocols used to represent and exchange cyber threat intelligence. STIX is a format for describing threat information, while TAXII is a transport mechanism for sharing that information.
