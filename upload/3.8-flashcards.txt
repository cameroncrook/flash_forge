Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP);CHAP is an authentication protocol used to authenticate a user or network device to an authentication entity, such as a network access server. It involves a challenge from the server and a response from the client. Usage: CHAP helps ensure the authenticity of the communicating parties by using a shared secret (password) without transmitting it over the network. It is commonly used in PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) connections.
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP);PAP is a simple authentication protocol where the username and password are sent in plaintext over the network. It is considered insecure because the credentials are not encrypted during transmission. Usage: PAP is used in some legacy systems and should be avoided in favor of more secure authentication methods, such as CHAP or EAP.
802.1X;802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control that provides an authentication framework for wired and wireless LANs (Local Area Networks). Usage: 802.1X enables devices to authenticate to a central server before being granted network access. It enhances network security by ensuring that only authorized and authenticated devices can connect to the network.
RADIUS;RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting management for users who connect and use a network service. Usage: RADIUS servers authenticate users and devices attempting to access a network, and they can also enforce policies and track usage for billing and auditing purposes.
Single sign-on (SSO);SSO is an authentication process that allows users to log in once and access multiple applications or services without needing to re-enter their credentials. Usage: SSO enhances user convenience and security by reducing the number of passwords users need to remember and minimizing the risk associated with password reuse.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML);SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). Usage: SAML enables secure single sign-on, allowing users to log in once with their identity provider and access various services and applications without re-authenticating.
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+);TACACS+ is a protocol used for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services in network security protocols. Usage: TACACS+ provides separate authentication, authorization, and accounting services, allowing for fine-grained control over user access and actions within a networked system.
OAuth;OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for granting applications limited access to a user's resources without sharing their credentials. Usage: OAuth is widely used for authorization and authentication in web applications, social media platforms, and APIs, allowing users to grant specific permissions to applications without exposing their login credentials.
OpenID;OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to be authenticated by certain co-operating sites (known as identity providers) using a third-party service. Usage: OpenID enables users to log in to multiple websites and services using a single digital identity. It provides a convenient and secure way to authenticate users across various platforms.
Kerberos;Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses secret-key cryptography to authenticate users and devices on a network. Usage: Kerberos provides secure authentication by allowing entities communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another while preventing eavesdropping and replay attacks.
Attribute-based access control (ABAC);ABAC is an access control model that evaluates attributes associated with users, systems, and resources to determine access permissions. Attributes can include user roles, environmental conditions, and resource properties. Usage: ABAC provides a flexible and dynamic way to control access based on various attributes, allowing organizations to define complex access policies that consider multiple factors before granting or denying access.
Role-based access control;RBAC is an access control model where access permissions are based on user roles. Users are assigned specific roles, and each role has certain permissions associated with it. Usage: RBAC simplifies access management by grouping users with similar job functions into roles and assigning permissions to those roles. It enhances security and ease of administration by ensuring that users have the necessary access rights based on their roles within the organization.
Rule-based access control;Rule-based access control uses predefined rules to determine access permissions. These rules specify conditions under which access is granted or denied. Usage: Rule-based access control allows organizations to define custom rules that consider various factors, such as time of day, location, or user behavior, to make access control decisions. It provides flexibility in access management.
MAC;MAC is a security model where access permissions are determined by the system and are based on security labels assigned to resources and users. Users cannot change their permissions. Usage: MAC is commonly used in government and military environments where strict access controls are necessary. It ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users based on security classifications.
Discretionary access control (DAC);DAC is an access control model where the owner of a resource has control over who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it. Usage: DAC allows resource owners to set access permissions and manage access control lists (ACLs) for their files and resources. It provides flexibility but can lead to security issues if permissions are not properly configured.
Conditional access;Conditional access policies are rules that determine access based on specific conditions, such as device compliance, user location, or network security posture. Usage: Conditional access enhances security by allowing organizations to define access policies tailored to specific scenarios. For example, access may be granted only if the user is using a trusted device and connecting from a secure network.
Privileged access management;PAM is a set of cybersecurity strategies and technologies for managing, controlling, and monitoring privileged access to critical systems and sensitive information. Usage: PAM solutions help organizations secure privileged accounts (such as administrative or root accounts) by implementing strict access controls, session monitoring, and credential management. PAM reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of privileged accounts.
Filesystem permissions;Filesystem permissions define the access rights of users or groups to files and directories on a computer system. These permissions include read, write, and execute privileges. Usage: Filesystem permissions are essential for controlling access to files and directories in operating systems. By setting appropriate permissions, administrators can ensure that only authorized users can access, modify, or execute specific files and directories.
