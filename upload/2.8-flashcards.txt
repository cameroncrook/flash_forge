Digital signatures;cryptographic techniques used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. They ensure that a message was created by a particular sender and has not been altered in transit. Digital signatures use asymmetric (public-key) cryptography where a private key is used to sign the message and a corresponding public key is used to verify the signature.
Key length;the size of the cryptographic key used in encryption algorithms. Longer keys generally provide stronger security because they increase the possible combinations that an attacker would have to try in order to break the encryption. Key length is measured in bits.
Key stretching;a technique used to enhance the security of passwords by making them longer and more complex. It involves applying a one-way hash function multiple times to a password, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers to perform brute-force attacks.
Salting;the process of adding a random or unique value (called a salt) to the data before hashing it. This technique is commonly used in password storage. Salting ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different due to the unique salts, making it more challenging for attackers to use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
Hashing;a process of converting input data (like a message or a file) into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. Hash functions are one-way functions, meaning it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original input from the hash value. Hashing is used for data integrity verification and password storage.
Key exchange;the process of securely sharing cryptographic keys between two parties, allowing them to establish a secure communication channel. Key exchange methods ensure that even if intercepted by an attacker, the exchanged keys cannot be easily deciphered, ensuring the confidentiality of the communication.
Elliptic-curve cryptography;a public-key cryptography technique based on elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides strong security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional public-key algorithms like RSA. It is particularly useful in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices and IoT devices.
Perfect forward secrecy;a property of key exchange protocols where the compromise of a long-term secret key does not compromise the confidentiality of past or future communications. In other words, even if an attacker obtains the long-term secret key, they cannot decrypt past communication sessions that were secured using temporary session keys, ensuring stronger security and privacy.
Communications;the use of quantum mechanics principles to secure communication channels. Quantum communication technologies, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), leverage the unique properties of quantum particles (such as photons) to enable secure communication between parties. Unlike classical encryption methods, quantum communication relies on the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. Quantum communications have the potential to provide unbreakable encryption, making them highly secure against attacks, including those based on quantum computing.
Computing;an area of computing that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers that use bits (which can be either 0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to a property called superposition. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the physical distance between them. Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems significantly faster than classical computers, making it a topic of intense research and interest in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and simulation.
Post-quantum;cryptographic algorithms and systems that are designed to be secure against attacks by quantum computers. As quantum computing technology advances, traditional cryptographic algorithms (such as RSA and ECC) could be broken using algorithms like Shor's algorithm. Post-quantum cryptography focuses on developing new cryptographic algorithms that would remain secure even in the presence of powerful quantum computers. Researchers are actively working on developing post-quantum cryptographic standards to ensure the security of digital communication in the quantum computing era.
Ephemeral;something that is temporary, fleeting, or short-lived. In the context of cryptography, ephemeral key exchange refers to the generation and use of temporary cryptographic keys for securing a communication session. Ephemeral keys are generated for each session and are discarded after use. Ephemeral key exchange protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange (in its Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman variant), provide perfect forward secrecy, ensuring that even if a long-term private key is compromised, past communication sessions remain secure because they were encrypted with session-specific, ephemeral keys.
Authenticated;cryptographic methods that not only provide confidentiality but also ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data being transmitted. These modes often use cryptographic techniques such as HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.
Unauthenticated;cryptographic methods that provide confidentiality but do not include mechanisms to authenticate or verify the integrity of the transmitted data. While they can encrypt data to keep it confidential, they do not guarantee that the data has not been altered in transit.
Counter;a mode of operation for block ciphers where each block of plaintext is XORed with the output of a counter encrypted with the key. CTR mode essentially turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, allowing for parallel encryption and decryption. It is important to note that CTR mode does not provide authentication on its own and should be used with an additional method, such as HMAC, for authentication.
Blockchain;decentralized and distributed digital ledgers used to record transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.
Public ledgers;a blockchain operates on the principle of a public, transparent, and decentralized network. Public ledgers are accessible to anyone, allowing for transparency and traceability of transactions. In public blockchain networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), transactions are recorded on the public ledger, making them visible to all participants, which ensures trust in the system without the need for a central authority.
Stream;combinations of algorithms used in cryptography to encrypt data one bit or byte at a time continuously, rather than in blocks. Stream ciphers are particularly useful for real-time applications and situations where a continuous stream of data needs to be encrypted or decrypted efficiently.
Block;combinations of algorithms used to encrypt and decrypt data in fixed-size blocks. Each block is processed independently, making block ciphers suitable for a wide range of applications, including data encryption, message authentication, and digital signatures. Common block cipher modes include Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), and Counter (CTR) mode, among others.
Symmetric vs. asymmetric;symmetric cryptography involves the use of a single secret key for both encryption and decryption of data. The same key is used by both the sender and the receiver to secure the communication. Symmetric algorithms are typically faster and more efficient for bulk data encryption. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. Information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key and vice versa. Asymmetric cryptography provides a secure way for two parties to exchange encrypted information without needing to share a secret key beforehand.
Lightweight cryptography;cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed specifically for resource-constrained devices and environments where computational power, memory, and energy efficiency are limited. These lightweight algorithms aim to provide adequate security while minimizing the use of system resources. Lightweight cryptography is essential for applications in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, RFID tags, embedded systems, and other low-power devices where traditional cryptographic algorithms might be too resource-intensive.
Steganography;the practice of concealing one piece of information within another in such a way that it is difficult or impossible to detect the hidden content. Unlike encryption, which focuses on making information unreadable, steganography focuses on hiding the existence of the information. Various media types can be used for steganographic purposes, including audio, video, and images.
Audio;hiding secret information within audio files. This can be achieved by subtly altering the audio signal to embed hidden data without significantly affecting the perceptible quality of the sound. Techniques can include modifying the least significant bits of the audio samples or utilizing frequency domain transformations to hide the data.
Video;conceals information within video files. Similar to audio steganography, it involves manipulating the video frames or the color channels in a way that the changes are imperceptible to the human eye. Video steganography techniques often exploit redundancies in video data, such as slight color or intensity variations, to hide information.
Image;the practice of hiding information within digital images. This is usually done by altering the pixel values or the color channels of the image. Common methods include Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion, where the least significant bit of each pixel is replaced with a bit of the hidden message, making subtle changes in the image that are difficult to detect without specialized software.
Homomorphic encryption;a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. In other words, you can process the encrypted data and get an encrypted result, which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations performed on the unencrypted data. This property is particularly useful for ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data while allowing computations and analysis to be performed on that data.
Low power devices;Cryptography is used in low-power devices, such as IoT (Internet of Things) sensors and wearable devices, to ensure secure communication while minimizing energy consumption. Lightweight cryptographic algorithms are often employed to perform secure operations efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Low latency;Cryptography in low-latency applications, like real-time communication systems and online gaming, focuses on encrypting and decrypting data quickly to minimize the time it takes for messages to be transmitted securely. Optimized cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation are utilized to reduce processing delays.
High resiliency;ensures that the encryption and decryption processes are robust and able to withstand attacks or tampering attempts. Robust algorithms, key management practices, and secure implementation techniques are employed to enhance the system's resilience against various threats.
Supporting confidentiality;encrypting sensitive data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Only authorized parties possessing the correct decryption key can access the original information, ensuring that sensitive content remains confidential and secure from eavesdroppers.
Supporting integrity;using hash functions and digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of data. Hash functions create unique fingerprints (hashes) of data, ensuring that it has not been altered. Digital signatures provide a way to verify the sender's identity and guarantee that the received data has not been tampered with during transmission.
Supporting obfuscation;a technique to hide the true meaning of data or algorithms. Techniques like encryption, hashing, and masking transform data into a format that is difficult to understand without proper decryption or knowledge, ensuring confidentiality and intellectual property protection.
Supporting authentication;employing techniques like digital signatures and authentication protocols. Digital signatures verify the sender's identity and the integrity of the message. Authentication protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensure the identity of communicating parties in online transactions.
Supporting non-repudiation;providing evidence of the origin, authenticity, and integrity of digital messages or transactions. Digital signatures, timestamps, and secure audit trails are used to establish proof that a particular party sent a message or performed a transaction, preventing the sender from denying their involvement.
Speed;Cryptographic operations can be time-consuming, especially for complex algorithms or large key sizes. Speed limitations may impact real-time applications or systems that require rapid data processing.
Size;Cryptographic keys and algorithms can require significant storage space, especially in constrained environments. Storing large keys or implementing robust algorithms might be impractical for devices with limited memory.
Weak keys;specific keys that, when used with certain cryptographic algorithms, result in compromised security. Identifying and avoiding weak keys is crucial to maintaining the strength of encryption.
Time;Cryptographic algorithms may lose effectiveness over time due to advances in technology, making them vulnerable to attacks that were previously infeasible. This limitation necessitates the periodic updating of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.
Longevity;Cryptographic systems must remain secure for long periods, especially in contexts like secure data storage. Ensuring the longevity of encryption methods requires anticipating future advancements in computational power and potential vulnerabilities.
Predictability;Predictable patterns or structures in data can weaken encryption. Cryptographic algorithms must be resistant to known-plaintext attacks, where an attacker can exploit predictable patterns in encrypted data.
Reuse;Reusing cryptographic keys or initialization vectors (IVs) can lead to security vulnerabilities, as patterns may emerge in encrypted data. Reusing keys compromises the confidentiality of multiple messages encrypted with the same key.
Entropy;Cryptographic systems require a high degree of entropy (randomness) in key generation and initialization vectors. Low entropy can result in predictable keys, making them vulnerable to attacks.
Computational overheads;Cryptographic operations often require significant computational resources, leading to overheads that impact system performance. Balancing security needs against computational costs is crucial, especially in resource-constrained environments.
Resource vs. security constraints;Balancing the need for robust security with the available resources (such as processing power, memory, and bandwidth) poses a challenge. Striking the right balance ensures effective protection without overwhelming the system's capabilities.
