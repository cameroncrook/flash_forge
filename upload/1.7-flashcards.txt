Threat hunting;The proactive process of actively searching for signs of malicious activities or threats within an organization's network or systems. Threat hunters use a combination of tools, techniques, and intelligence sources to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
Intelligence fusion;The practice of gathering, analyzing, and combining various sources of threat intelligence, such as indicators of compromise (IoCs), vulnerabilities, and attack patterns, to create a comprehensive and actionable view of potential threats. This aids threat hunters in understanding the context and relevance of threats.
Threat feeds;External sources of continuously updated threat intelligence, including information on emerging threats, known attack patterns, and malicious activities. Threat hunters often subscribe to threat feeds to stay informed about the latest threats.
Advisories and bulletins;Notifications and reports issued by cybersecurity organizations, government agencies, or vendors that provide information about known vulnerabilities, exploits, or emerging threats. Threat hunters use these advisories to prioritize their hunting efforts and take preventive measures.
Maneuver;A term used to describe the actions taken by a threat actor within a network or system after an initial compromise. Threat hunters analyze these maneuvers to understand the attacker's tactics, techniques, and goals, which can help in tracking and responding to the threat.
Vulnerability scans;Automated processes that assess computer systems, networks, or applications to identify security weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and potential points of exploitation. These scans help organizations proactively manage and mitigate security risks.
False positives;Results from a vulnerability scan that incorrectly identify a vulnerability or security issue that does not actually exist. False positives can lead to unnecessary investigation and remediation efforts.
False negatives;Results from a vulnerability scan that fail to detect a real vulnerability or security issue that does exist. False negatives can result in missed security risks.
Log reviews;The examination of system, application, or network logs to detect and investigate security incidents, anomalies, or suspicious activities. Log reviews are often part of post-vulnerability scan analysis.
Credentialed vs. non-credentialed;Credentialed Scans: Vulnerability scans conducted with valid user credentials, allowing the scanner to access and assess the target system more thoroughly, including configuration settings and software updates. Non-Credentialed Scans: Vulnerability scans performed without user credentials, providing a limited view of the target system's vulnerabilities, often focusing on network-based vulnerabilities.
Intrusive vs. non-intrusive;Vulnerability scans that actively interact with the target system to identify vulnerabilities, potentially causing disruptions or affecting system performance. Vulnerability scans that observe and analyze the target system's behavior without actively interacting with it, minimizing potential disruptions.
Application;In the context of vulnerability scans, this refers to software programs or code that run on a computer system. Vulnerability scans assess applications for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
Web application;A specific type of application that is accessed and operated through web browsers. Vulnerability scans for web applications focus on identifying security weaknesses in web-based software.
Network;In the context of vulnerability scans, this refers to the interconnected system of devices and communication pathways (wired or wireless). Vulnerability scans assess network infrastructure for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS);CVE: A standardized list of known software vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by the MITRE Corporation. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique CVE identifier. CVSS: A scoring system used to assess and quantify the severity of vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first based on their potential impact and exploitability.
Configuration review;The assessment of system and network configurations to identify misconfigurations and security weaknesses that may result in vulnerabilities or exposure to threats. This is often part of vulnerability scanning and assessment.
Review reports;Documents generated by a SIEM system that summarize and provide insights into security events, incidents, or logs. These reports are often used for analysis and decision-making.
Packet capture;The process of intercepting and recording network packets (data units) for the purpose of analysis and troubleshooting. Packet capture is used in network security to investigate suspicious or malicious network traffic.
Data inputs;The various sources of data that a SIEM system collects and analyzes, including logs, events, and network traffic data. Data inputs provide the raw information for security monitoring.
User behavior analysis;The practice of monitoring and analyzing the actions and patterns of user activities within a network or system to detect abnormal or suspicious behavior. It helps in identifying potential insider threats or compromised accounts.
Sentiment analysis;An analytical technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in textual data. In cybersecurity, sentiment analysis can be applied to logs and messages to identify potential security issues or threats based on the language used.
Security monitoring;The continuous observation of an organization's systems, networks, and data for signs of security incidents, vulnerabilities, or abnormal behavior. SIEM systems play a crucial role in security monitoring.
Log aggregation;The process of collecting and centralizing log data from various sources, such as servers, firewalls, and endpoints, into a single repository. This makes it easier to analyze and correlate logs for security purposes.
Log collectors;Components or systems within a SIEM infrastructure responsible for collecting log and event data from multiple sources. Log collectors forward this data to the SIEM platform for analysis and reporting.
Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR);a cybersecurity strategy and technology framework that combines security orchestration (coordination of security processes and workflows), automation (execution of tasks and processes without human intervention), and response (actions taken to address security incidents and threats). SOAR platforms enable organizations to streamline and improve their incident response processes, allowing them to respond to security events more efficiently and effectively while reducing manual efforts.
