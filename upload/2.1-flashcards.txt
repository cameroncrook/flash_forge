Configuration management (cm);a set of practices that are designed to ensure that configuration items are deployed in a consistent state and stay that way throughout their entire lifetime.
Diagrams;visual representations of system architectures, network layouts, and configurations. These diagrams help cybersecurity professionals and IT teams understand the overall structure of systems and networks. Clear diagrams aid in identifying potential vulnerabilities, ensuring secure configurations, and devising effective security strategies.
Baseline configuration;used as a basis for future builds and releases. a predefined set of specifications and settings that serve as a foundation for system or network security. It represents a secure and stable configuration against which all systems or devices within an organization are compared. Deviations from the baseline can indicate potential security risks, making baseline configurations a key element in risk reduction strategies.
Standard naming conventions;guidelines for naming various system components, files, users, and other entities within a network. Consistent naming conventions help in easily identifying and managing resources. In cybersecurity, standard naming conventions enhance security by ensuring that system entities are correctly identified, reducing the risk of confusion or misconfiguration.
Internet protocol (IP) schema;outlines the structured plan for assigning and managing IP addresses within a network. It includes rules and conventions for allocating IP addresses to devices, subnets, and network segments. A well-designed IP schema helps in organizing the network efficiently, reduces the risk of IP conflicts, and enhances security by logically segmenting devices based on their functions or security levels.
Data sovereignty;refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is located. It implies that governments have the authority to regulate data stored within their borders, and organizations operating in a particular country must comply with the local data protection and privacy laws. Data sovereignty often impacts where and how businesses and organizations choose to store their data to ensure compliance with regional legal requirements and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Data loss prevention (DLP);Refers to a set of strategies and tools used to ensure that sensitive data is not leaked, lost, or accessed by unauthorized users. It involves policies and technologies to prevent unauthorized access, sharing, or transmission of sensitive information.
Masking;Also known as data obfuscation, is the process of disguising original data to protect sensitive information while maintaining its authenticity. This technique is often used to hide specific data within a database or other data storage systems.
Encryption;the process of converting plain text or data into a code (cipher text) to prevent unauthorized access. It uses algorithms and encryption keys to secure data, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and access the original information.
At rest;refers to data that is stored on physical or digital media and is not actively being transmitted or processed. Protecting data at rest involves securing it on storage devices such as hard drives, SSDs, or servers to prevent unauthorized access.
In transit/motion;refers to data that is actively moving from one location to another, such as data being transmitted over a network or the internet. Encrypting data in transit ensures that it remains secure while being transferred between systems.
In processing;refers to data that is actively being used or manipulated by applications, software, or processes. Protecting data in processing involves implementing security measures within applications and systems to safeguard sensitive information during operations.
Tokenization;the process of replacing sensitive data with unique identifiers called tokens. These tokens are randomly generated and have no meaningful connection to the original data, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access or misuse sensitive information.
Rights management;involves controlling and managing permissions associated with digital content or data. It defines who can access, modify, share, or delete specific pieces of information, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals or entities.
Response and recovery controls;Response and recovery controls in cybersecurity refer to the strategies, processes, and technologies implemented to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or breaches. These controls are designed to minimize the impact of an incident, restore affected systems to normal operation, and prevent future occurrences.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection;a cybersecurity process that involves decrypting and inspecting encrypted SSL/TLS traffic to identify malicious content or activities. It is commonly used in security appliances like firewalls and proxies to analyze encrypted communications, ensuring that encrypted data is not used to conceal threats.
Hashing;the process of converting input data (such as a file or a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value. Hashing algorithms are designed to be one-way functions, meaning it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original input from the hash value. Hashing is commonly used for data integrity verification and password storage.
API considerations;evaluating and implementing security measures related to APIs. This includes ensuring secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, validating input data to prevent injection attacks, encrypting data transmitted via APIs, and implementing proper access controls. API security is crucial, especially in modern applications and cloud services, to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
Hot site;a fully operational offsite facility that is equipped with necessary hardware, software, and data to rapidly resume business operations in the event of a disaster. All systems and data are continuously mirrored and updated at the hot site, ensuring minimal downtime and maximum site resiliency. Hot sites are costly but provide the quickest recovery times.
Cold site;an offsite facility that is not pre-equipped with IT infrastructure. In the event of a disaster, the organization must install and configure hardware, software, and restore data backups before operations can resume. Cold sites have a longer recovery time compared to hot sites because they lack immediate readiness, but they are more cost-effective.
Warm site;a middle-ground option between hot and cold sites. It is a partially equipped offsite facility that contains some hardware and infrastructure, but not all. In the event of a disaster, organizations need to install and configure specific components and restore data, reducing recovery time compared to a cold site. Warm sites offer a balance between cost and recovery time.
Deception and disruption;involve deliberately misleading attackers or intruders within a network. Deception techniques create fake systems, services, or data to divert attackers' attention, while disruption techniques aim to interrupt or limit the attacker's activities, hindering their progress or preventing unauthorized access.
Honeypots;decoy computer systems or networks designed to attract attackers. These systems appear to be legitimate but are actually isolated and monitored. Security professionals use honeypots to study attackers' methods, gather intelligence, and understand emerging threats without risking real production systems.
Honeyfiles;decoy files that are placed within a system to attract attackers. Similar to honeypots, honeyfiles are designed to deceive attackers into interacting with them, allowing security teams to detect and analyze malicious activities.
Honeynets;entire networks of honeypots. They consist of multiple interconnected honeypots and other security devices, forming a larger and more complex deception environment. Honeynets are used to detect widespread attacks, study attacker behaviors across multiple systems, and enhance overall threat intelligence.
Fake telemetry;involves sending false or misleading data to attackers or malicious software. This technique aims to confuse attackers, disrupt their activities, and prevent them from accurately assessing the security posture of a system or network. Fake telemetry can include fabricated network traffic, system logs, or application data.
DNS sinkhole;a DNS server or network device that redirects specific domain names or IP addresses to a different location, effectively blocking access to the original, potentially malicious, or unwanted content. DNS sinkholes are commonly used to prevent malware from communicating with command and control servers or to block access to malicious websites by redirecting requests to a non-existent or harmless destination.
