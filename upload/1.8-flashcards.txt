Known environment;A penetration testing scenario where the tester has complete knowledge of the target system, including its architecture, configurations, and security measures.
Unknown environment;A penetration testing scenario where the tester has no prior knowledge of the target system. The goal is to simulate a real-world cyberattack with minimal initial information.
Partially known environment;A scenario where the tester has limited knowledge of the target system, such as specific IP addresses or network segments, but lacks comprehensive details about the entire environment.
Rules of engagement;A document outlining the scope, limitations, and guidelines of a penetration test. It defines what the tester can and cannot do, ensuring that the testing process remains ethical and legal.
Lateral movement;The technique used by attackers to move horizontally across a network after gaining initial access. In penetration testing, testers simulate this to assess the security of a network against internal threats.
Privilege escalation;The process of gaining higher-level access or privileges on a system or network, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or perform malicious activities. Testers attempt this to evaluate the system's ability to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.
Persistence;The ability of malware or an attacker to maintain a presence within a system or network over an extended period without being detected. In penetration testing, testers assess the system's ability to detect and remove persistent threats.
Cleanup;The process of removing any traces of the penetration testing activities, including files, accounts, and other artifacts. It ensures that the target system is returned to its original state after the test is completed.
Bug bounty;A reward program offered by organizations to independent security researchers for discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities in their systems. It encourages ethical hackers to find and disclose vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
Pivoting;The technique of using a compromised system as a foothold to attack other systems within the same network. In penetration testing, pivoting is simulated to assess the security measures against internal threats and lateral movement.
Drones;Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with sensors or cameras used for reconnaissance and data gathering. In cybersecurity, drones can be used for aerial reconnaissance to assess physical security measures or to map Wi-Fi networks.
War flying;The practice of using a drone or aircraft to scan and map wireless networks and devices from the air. War flying is a form of wardriving conducted from the sky, allowing attackers to identify vulnerable or unsecured wireless networks.
War driving;The act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks while driving a vehicle. Attackers use this technique to find open or poorly secured Wi-Fi networks, allowing them to gain unauthorized access or conduct other malicious activities.
Footprinting;The process of collecting as much information as possible about a target system, network, or organization to identify potential vulnerabilities and weak points. Footprinting involves gathering information from publicly available sources, websites, social media, and other means to understand the target's infrastructure and security posture.
OSINT;The collection and analysis of information that is publicly available and accessible to anyone. OSINT includes data from public websites, social media platforms, online forums, and other open sources. In cybersecurity, OSINT is valuable for reconnaissance activities, providing insights into potential targets and their security vulnerabilities.
Red-team;A group of cybersecurity professionals or ethical hackers who simulate real-world cyberattacks to test and evaluate an organization's security defenses. The red team's goal is to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system, often by using tactics similar to those employed by malicious hackers.
Blue-team;A group of cybersecurity professionals responsible for defending an organization's IT systems and networks. Blue teams focus on implementing security measures, monitoring for security incidents, and responding to cyber threats in real-time. They work to prevent, detect, and mitigate security breaches.
White-team;In the context of cybersecurity exercises or competitions (such as capture the flag events), the white team is responsible for overseeing the rules, ensuring fair play, and acting as referees or judges. They do not actively participate in the attack or defense but rather maintain the integrity of the competition.
Purple-team;A collaborative approach that combines elements of both red teaming and blue teaming. In a purple team exercise, red team members work closely with blue team members. The red team simulates attacks, and the blue team defends against them in real-time. The goal is to enhance communication and understanding between the offensive and defensive teams, leading to improved overall security posture.
