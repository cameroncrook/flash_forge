Containerization;Containerization separates work-related data and applications from personal data on a device. MDM solutions use containers to create secure, isolated environments, ensuring that corporate data remains protected without compromising personal privacy.
Storage segmentation;Storage segmentation divides the device's storage into secure and non-secure areas. Corporate data is stored securely, separate from personal data, reducing the risk of data leakage and enhancing overall security.
Full device encryption;Full device encryption encrypts all data on the device, ensuring that even if the device is lost or stolen, the data remains inaccessible without the proper decryption key. MDM solutions enforce and manage encryption settings to protect sensitive information.
MicroSD hardware security module (HSM);A Hardware Security Module is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides cryptoprocessing. A MicroSD HSM is a specific type of HSM designed to be integrated into the MicroSD card form factor. It adds an extra layer of hardware-based security to mobile devices, especially useful for secure storage of sensitive data, encryption keys, and authentication credentials.
MDM/Unified Endpoint Management (UEM);MDM (Mobile Device Management) and UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) are solutions used by organizations to manage and secure mobile devices and endpoints (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers). MDM focuses on mobile devices, while UEM extends management capabilities to various endpoints, including desktops and laptops. These systems enable IT administrators to enforce security policies, manage applications, and remotely configure devices, ensuring compliance and data protection.
Mobile application management (MAM);Mobile Application Management involves controlling and securing access to mobile applications used within an organization. MAM solutions allow administrators to manage and secure specific applications, ensuring they are up-to-date, compliant with security policies, and protect sensitive data. MAM is often used in conjunction with MDM/UEM to provide comprehensive mobile security.
SEAndroid;SEAndroid is a security extension for the Android operating system. It implements mandatory access controls based on SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) principles. SEAndroid enhances the security of Android devices by isolating and protecting system resources, preventing unauthorized access and malicious activities. It's a critical component for securing Android devices used in enterprise and government environments.
Third-party application stores;These are digital platforms, other than official app stores like Google Play Store or Apple App Store, where users can download and install applications. Monitoring and restricting third-party app stores help prevent the installation of malicious or unverified apps.
Rooting/jailbreaking;Rooting (Android) and Jailbreaking (iOS) are processes that remove software restrictions imposed by the device manufacturer or operating system. This allows users to gain privileged control over the device. However, it can pose security risks as it bypasses built-in security mechanisms.
Sideloading;Sideloading refers to installing applications on a mobile device from sources other than the official app store. Enforcing restrictions on sideloading helps prevent the installation of potentially harmful apps.
Custom firmware;Custom firmware refers to modified versions of the device's operating system. Enforcing restrictions on custom firmware installation ensures the integrity and security of the device's software.
Carrier unlocking;Carrier unlocking allows a mobile device to be used with different mobile carriers. While legal, it can impact device security, especially if done through unauthorized methods. Monitoring ensures compliance with carrier policies.
Firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates;OTA updates are wireless software updates sent to mobile devices by manufacturers or carriers. Enforcing OTA updates ensures devices receive the latest security patches and features, enhancing overall security.

Bring your own device (BYOD);BYOD is a policy where employees use their personal devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops) for work purposes. It offers flexibility to employees but requires robust security measures to separate personal and corporate data on the same device, often implemented through MDM/UEM solutions.
Corporate-owned personally enabled (COPE);COPE is a model where the organization provides employees with corporate-owned devices. However, employees are allowed to use these devices for personal tasks as well. IT departments enforce security policies on these devices, balancing corporate control and employee freedom.
Choose your own device (CYOD);CYOD allows employees to choose their devices from a list approved by the organization. Employees have a selection of devices that meet the company's security and compatibility requirements. This model provides a balance between employee preference and standardization for security and management purposes.
Corporate-owned;In this traditional model, the organization provides and owns the devices used by employees. IT departments have complete control over these devices, ensuring standardized security policies and configurations across the entire device fleet.
Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI);VDI is a technology that allows a user's desktop environment to be hosted on a remote server and accessed over a network. With mobile devices, VDI enables employees to access their work desktop environment, applications, and data securely from their smartphones or tablets. It centralizes management and enhances security by keeping sensitive data within the corporate network.
