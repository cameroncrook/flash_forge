Cloud-based;Security weaknesses or flaws that exist in cloud computing environments, such as cloud service providers' infrastructure or configurations. These vulnerabilities can affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data and services hosted in the cloud.
on-premises vulnerabilities;Security weaknesses or flaws that exist within an organization's own physical infrastructure or data centers. These vulnerabilities pertain to systems, servers, and applications that are not hosted in the cloud but are managed and maintained locally by the organization.
Zero-day;A software vulnerability or security flaw that is newly discovered and has not yet been patched or mitigated by the software vendor. "Zero-day" refers to the fact that there are zero days of protection against the vulnerability because it is exploited by attackers before a fix or patch is available. Zero-day vulnerabilities are considered high-risk and are typically valuable to cybercriminals and nation-state actors.
Open permissions;A configuration setting in which files, directories, or resources have overly permissive access controls, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read, modify, or delete them. This can lead to data leaks or unauthorized access.
Unsecure root accounts;Root accounts or superuser accounts with weak or easily guessable passwords, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. Root accounts have the highest level of privilege on a system.
Errors;Configuration mistakes or misconfigurations in software, systems, or network settings that can introduce vulnerabilities. Errors can include improper access controls, misconfigured firewalls, or flawed application settings.
Weak encryption;The use of encryption algorithms or keys that do not provide strong protection for data. Weak encryption can be susceptible to decryption attacks, putting sensitive information at risk.
Unsecure protocols;The use of outdated or insecure communication protocols that lack modern security features, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping or exploitation by attackers.
Default settings;Configuration settings that are left in their default state, often with weak security configurations. Attackers may target systems with default settings because they are well-known and can be easier to exploit.
Open ports and services;Network ports and services that are accessible from the internet or a network without adequate security measures. Open ports can be entry points for attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks on systems or services.
Third-party risks;These are risks that arise when an organization relies on external parties, such as vendors, suppliers, contractors, or service providers, to support its operations, provide services, or contribute to its technology stack. These risks can encompass various security, compliance, operational, and reputational issues that may affect the organization if the third party does not meet expected standards.
Vendor management;The risk associated with inadequately monitoring and overseeing third-party vendors who provide products or services to an organization. This risk includes issues related to vendor reliability, security, and performance.
System integration;The risk that arises when third-party systems or software components are integrated into an organization's infrastructure. Integration issues can lead to vulnerabilities, incompatibilities, or operational disruptions.
Lack of vendor support;The risk posed by using third-party products or services for which the vendor no longer provides updates, patches, or support. This can leave the organization exposed to security vulnerabilities.
Supply chain;The risk associated with third-party suppliers and partners within an organization's supply chain. This includes the potential for compromises, disruptions, or security incidents in the supply chain that can impact the organization's operations and security.
Outsourced code development;The risk associated with outsourcing software development to third-party organizations or contractors. This includes concerns about code quality, security, intellectual property, and compliance.
Data storage;The risk associated with storing sensitive or critical data with third-party cloud storage providers or data center operators. This risk includes concerns about data security, privacy, availability, and compliance with regulations.
Firmware;Neglecting to regularly update firmware on devices such as routers, switches, and IoT devices, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits and security vulnerabilities.
Operating system (OS);Choosing to skip or delay the installation of security patches for the operating system, leaving the system exposed to known vulnerabilities. Also Installing some OS updates but neglecting others, resulting in an inconsistent security posture.
Applications;Not regularly updating software applications (e.g., web browsers, productivity software, and databases) to address security vulnerabilities and bugs. Also Running outdated versions of applications that are no longer supported by vendors, making them susceptible to known exploits.
Legacy platforms;older computer systems, hardware, software, or technologies that are outdated and no longer in mainstream use or actively supported by their developers or manufacturers. These systems may still be in use due to their historical significance, critical functions, or the cost and complexity of upgrading or replacing them. Legacy platforms often pose security and compatibility risks because they lack modern features, updates, and support.
Data loss;The unintentional or accidental loss of access to, destruction, or corruption of digital data. This can result from various factors, including hardware failures, software errors, or human mistakes.
Data breaches;Unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive or confidential data to unauthorized parties. Data breaches can occur due to cyberattacks, insider threats, or security vulnerabilities.
Data exfiltration;The unauthorized copying, transfer, or theft of data from a computer, network, or system by an attacker. This often involves the removal of data for malicious purposes.
Identity theft;The fraudulent use of someone's personal information, such as their name, Social Security number, or financial details, to commit various crimes, including financial fraud and impersonation.
Financial;The negative consequences on an organization's finances resulting from a security incident or breach. This can include financial losses due to fraud, legal expenses, and costs associated with remediation.
Reputation;Harm to an individual or organization's public image and credibility caused by a security incident or breach. A damaged reputation can result in a loss of trust from customers, partners, and the public.
Availability loss;The unavailability or disruption of critical systems, services, or resources, often due to cyberattacks or technical failures. Availability loss can impact business operations and customer satisfaction.
